<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>It may be considered a strange wish on the part of an Author, to have his
preface compared to a donkey’s gallop. We are nevertheless desirous that
our own should be considered both short and sweet. For our part, indeed,
we would have every preface as short as an orator’s cough, to which, in
purpose, it is so nearly like; but Fashion requires, and like the rest of
her sex, requires <i>because</i> she requires, that before a writer begins the
business of his book, he should give an account to the world of his
reasons for producing it; and therefore, to avoid singularity, we shall
proceed with the statement of our own, excepting only a few private ones,
which are neither here nor there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>To advance the interests of mankind by promoting the cause of Education;
to ameliorate the conversation of the masses; to cultivate Taste, and
diffuse Refinement; these are the objects which we have in view in
submitting a Comic English Grammar to the patronage of a discerning
Public. Nor have we been actuated by philanthropic motives alone, but also
by a regard to Patriotism, which, as it has been pronounced on high
authority to be the last refuge of a scoundrel, must necessarily be the
first concern of an aspiring and disinterested mind. We felt ourselves
called upon to do as much, at least, for Modern England as we had before
done for Ancient Rome; and having been considered by competent judges to
have infused a little liveliness into a dead language, we were bold enough
to hope that we might extract some amusement from a living one.</p>

<p>Few persons there are, whose ears are so extremely obtuse, as not to be
frequently annoyed at the violations of Grammar by which they are so often
assailed. It is really painful to be forced, in walking along the streets,
to hear such phrases as, “That <i>’ere h</i>omnibus.” “Where’ve you <i>bin</i>.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
“<i>Vot’s</i> the <i>h</i>odds?” and the like. Very dreadful expressions are also
used by draymen and others in addressing their horses. What can possibly
induce a human being to say “Gee woot!” “’Mather way!” or “Woa?” not to
mention the atrocious “Kim aup!” of the ignorant and degraded
costermonger. We once actually heard a fellow threaten to “pitch into” his
dog! meaning, we believe, to beat the animal.</p>

<p>It is notorious that the above and greater enormities are perpetrated in
spite of the number of Grammars already before the world. This fact
sufficiently excuses the present addition to the stock; and as serious
English Grammars have hitherto failed to effect the desired reformation,
we are induced to attempt it by means of a Comic one.</p>

<p>With regard to the moral tendency of our labours, we may here be permitted
to remark, that they will tend, if successful, to the suppression of <i>evil
speaking</i>.</p>

<p>We shall only add, that as the Spartans used to exhibit a tipsy slave to
their children with a view to disgust them with drunkenness, so we, by
giving a few examples here and there, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> incorrect phraseology, shall
expose, in their naked deformity, the vices of speech to the ingenuous
reader.</p>

<h2>PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE.</h2>


<p>Our native country having been, from time immemorial, entitled <i>Merry</i>
England, it is clear that, provided it has been called by a right name, a
Comic Grammar will afford the most hopeful means of teaching its
inhabitants their language.</p>

<p>That the epithet in question has been correctly applied, it will therefore
be our business to show.</p>

<p>If we can only prove that things which foreigners regard in the most
serious point of view, and which, perhaps, ought in reality to be so
considered, afford the modern Minotaur John Bull, merely matter of
amusement, we shall go far towards the establishment of our position. We
hope to do this and more also.</p>

<p>Births, marriages, and deaths, especially the latter, must be allowed to
be matters of some consequence. Every one knows what jokes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> made upon
the two first subjects. Those which the remaining one affords, we shall
proceed to consider.</p>

<p>Suicide, for instance, is looked upon by Mr. Bull with a very different
eye from that with which his neighbours regard it. As to an abortive
attempt thereat, it excites in his mind unmitigated ridicule, instead of
interest and sympathy. In Paris a foolish fellow, discontented with the
world, or, more probably, failing in some attempt to make himself
conspicuous, ties a brickbat to his neck, and jumps, at twelve o’clock of
the day, into the Seine. He thereby excites great admiration in the minds
of the bystanders; but were he to play the same trick on London Bridge, as
soon as he had been pulled out of the water he would only be laughed at
for his pains.</p>

<p>There was a certain gentleman, an officer in the navy, one Lieutenant
Luff; at least we have never heard the fact of his existence disputed; who
used to spend all his time in drinking grog; and at last, when he could
get no more, thought proper to shoot himself through the chest. In France
he would have been buried in Père La Chaise, or some such place, and would
have had an ode written to his memory. As his native country, however, was
the scene of his exploit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> he was interred, for the affair happened some
years ago, in a cross-road; and his fate has been made the subject of a
comic song.</p>

<p>That our countrymen regard Death as a jest, no one who considers their
bravery in war or their appetite in peace, can possibly doubt. And the
expressions, “to hop the twig,” “to kick the bucket,” “to go off the
hooks,” “to turn up the toes,” and so on, vernacularly used as synonymous
with “to expire,” sufficiently show the jocular light in which the last
act of the farce of Life is viewed in Her Majesty’s dominions.</p>

<p>An execution is looked upon abroad as a serious affair; but with us it is
quite another matter. Capital punishments, whatever they may be to the
sufferers, are to the spectators, if we may judge from their behaviour,
little else than capital jokes. The terms which, in common discourse, are
used by the humble classes to denote the pensile state, namely, “dancing
on nothing,” “having a drop too much,” or “being troubled with a line,”
are quite playful, and the “Last Dying Speech” of the criminal is usually
a species of composition which might well be called “An Entertaining
Narrative illustrated with Humourous Designs.”</p>

<p>The play of George Barnwell, in which a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> deluded linendraper’s apprentice
commits a horrid murder on the body of a pious uncle, excites, whenever it
is represented, as much amusement as if it were a comedy; and there is
also a ballad detailing the same circumstances, which, when sung at
convivial meetings, is productive of much merriment. Billy Taylor, too,
another ballad of the same sort, celebrates, in jocund strains, an act of
unjustifiable homicide.</p>

<p>Even the terrors of the other world are converted, in Great Britain, into
the drolleries of this. The awful apparitions of the unfortunate Miss
Bailey, and the equally unfortunate Mr. Giles Scroggins, have each of them
furnished the materials of a comical ditty; and the terrific appearance of
the Ghost of a Sheep’s Head to one William White,&mdash;a prodigy which would
be considered in Germany as fearful in the extreme, has been applied, by
some popular but anonymous writer, to the same purpose. The bodily
ablation of an unprincipled exciseman by the Prince of Darkness, a
circumstance in itself certainly of a serious nature, has been recorded by
one of our greatest poets in strains by no means remarkable for gravity.
The appellation, “Old Nick,” applied by the vulgar to the Prince in
question, is, in every sense of the words, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> nickname; and the aliases by
which, like many of his subjects, he is also called and known, such as
“Old Scratch,” “Old Harry,” or “The Old Gentleman,” are, to say the very
least of them, terms that border on the familiar.</p>

<p>In the popular drama of Punch,<small><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1" href="#f1">[1]</a></small> we observe
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> perfect climax of
atrocities and horrors. Victim after victim falls prostrate beneath the
cudgel of the deformed and barbarous monster; the very first who feels his
tyranny being the wife of his bosom. He, meanwhile, behaves in the most
heartless manner, actually singing and capering among the mangled
carcases. Benevolence is shocked, Justice is derided, Law is set at
nought, and Constables are slain. The fate to which he had been consigned
by a Jury of his Country is eluded; and the Avenger of Crime is
circumvented by the wily assassin. Lastly, to crown the whole, Retribution
herself is mocked; and the very Arch Fiend is dismissed to his own
dominions with a fractured skull. And at every stage of these frightful
proceedings shouts of uproarious laughter attest the delight of the
beholders, increasing in violence with every additional terror, and
swelling at the concluding one to an almost inextinguishable peal.</p>

<p>Indeed there is scarcely any shocking thing out of which we can extract no
amusement, except the loss of money, wherein, at least when it is our own,
we cannot see anything to laugh at.</p>

<p>Some will say that we make it a principle to convert whatever frightens
other people into a jest, in order that we may imbibe a contempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> for
danger; and that our superiority (universally admitted) over all nations
in courage and prowess, is, in fact, owing to the way which we have
acquired of laughing all terrors, natural and supernatural, utterly to
scorn. With these, however, we do not agree. Our national laughter is, in
our opinion, as little based on principle as our national actions have of
late years been. We laugh from impulse, or, as we do everything else,
because we choose. And we shall find, on examination, that we have
contrived, amongst us, to render a great many things exceedingly droll and
absurd, without having the slightest reason to assign for so doing.</p>

<p>For example, there is nothing in the office of a Parish Clerk that makes
it desirable that he should be a ludicrous person. There is no reason why
he should have a cracked voice; an inability to use, or a tendency to
omit, the aspirate; a stupid countenance; or a pompous manner. Nor do we
clearly see why he should be unable to pronounce proper names; should say
Snatchacrab for Sennacherib, or Leftenant for Leviathan. Such,
nevertheless, are the peculiarities by which he is commonly distinguished.</p>

<p>We are likewise at a loss to divine why so studiously ridiculous a costume
has been made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> enhance the natural absurdity of a Beadle; for we can
hardly believe that his singular style of dress was really intended to
inspire small children with veneration and awe.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be supposed that a Lord Mayor’s Show was instituted only
to be laughed at; yet who would contend that it is of any other use? Nor
could the office of the Chief Magistrate of a Corporation, nor that of an
Alderman, have been created for the amusement of the Public: there is,
however, no purpose which both of them so frequently serve.</p>

<p>If the wig and robes of a Judge were meant to excite the respect of the
community in general, and the fear of the unconscientious part of it, we
cannot but think that the design has been unsuccessful. That the ministers
of justice are not, in fact, so reverently held, by any means, as from the
nature of their functions they might be expected to be, is certain. A
magistrate, to go no further, is universally known, if not designated, by
the jocose appellation of “Beak.”</p>

<p>Butchers, bakers, cobblers, tinkers, costermongers, and tailors; to say
nothing of footmen, waiters, dancing-masters, and barbers have become the
subjects of ridicule to an extent not warranted by their avocations,
simply considered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>But the comical mind, like the jaundiced eye, views everything through a
coloured medium. Such a mind is that of the generality of Britons. We
distinguish even the nearest ties of relationship by facetious names. A
father is called “Dad,” or “The Governor;” an uncle, “Nunkey;” and a wife,
“a rib,” or more pleasantly still, as in the advertisements, an
“encumbrance.” Almost every being or thing, indeed, has in English two
words to express it, an ordinary and an odd one; and so greatly has the
number of expressions of the kind last mentioned increased of late, that,
as it appears to us, a new edition of Johnson’s Dictionary, enriched with
modern additions, is imperatively called for. When we talk of odd words,
we have no fear that our meaning will be misunderstood. It is true that
there are some few individuals who complain that they do not see any wit
in calling a sheep’s-head a “jemmy,” legs “bandies,” or a hand a “mawley;”
and it is also true that there was once a mathematician, who, after
reading through Milton’s Paradise Lost, wanted to know what it all proved?</p>

<p>And now that we are speaking of names, we may mention a few which are
certainly of a curious nature, and which no foreigner could possibly have
invented; unless, which would be likely enough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> he meant to apply them
seriously. The names we allude to are names of places&mdash;and pretty places
they are too; as, “Mount Pleasant,” “Paradise Row,” “Golden Lane.”</p>

<p>Then there are a great many whimsical things that we do:&mdash;</p>

<p>When a man cannot pay his debts, and has no prospect of being able to do
so except by working, we shut him up in gaol, and humorously describe his
condition as that of being in Quod.</p>

<p>We will not allow a man to give an old woman a dose of rhubarb if he have
not acquired at least half a dozen sciences; but we permit a quack to sell
as much poison as he pleases, with no other diploma than what he gets from
the “College of Health.”</p>

<p>When a thief pleads “Guilty” to an indictment, he is advised by the Judge
to recall his plea; as if a trial were a matter of sport, and the culprit,
like a fox, gave no amusement unless regularly run down. This perhaps is
the reason why allowing an animal to start some little time before the
pursuit is commenced, is called giving him <i>law</i>.</p>

<p>When one man runs away with another’s wife, and, being on that account
challenged to fight a duel, shoots the aggrieved party through the head,
the latter is said to receive <i>satisfaction</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>We never take a glass of wine at dinner without getting somebody else to
do the same, as if we wanted encouragement; and then, before we venture to
drink, we bow to each other across the table, preserving all the while a
most wonderful gravity. This, however, it may be said, is the natural
result of endeavouring to keep one another in countenance.</p>

<p>The way in which we imitate foreign manners and customs is very amusing.
Savages stick fish-bones through their noses; our fair countrywomen have
hoops of metal poked through their ears. The Caribs flatten the forehead;
the Chinese compress the foot; and we possess similar contrivances for
reducing the figure of a young lady to a resemblance to an hour-glass or a
devil-on-two-sticks.</p>

<p>There being no other assignable motive for these and the like proceedings,
it is reasonable to suppose that they are adopted, as schoolboys say, “for
fun.”</p>

<p>We could go on, were it necessary, adducing facts to an almost unlimited
extent; but we consider that enough has now been said in proof of the
comic character of the national mind. And in conclusion, if any foreign
author can be produced, equal in point of wit, humour, and drollery, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Swift, Sterne, or Butler, we hereby engage to eat him; albeit we have no
pretensions to the character of a “helluo librorum.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="huge">THE<br />COMIC ENGLISH GRAMMAR.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“English Grammar,” according to Lindley Murray, “is the art of speaking
and writing the English language with propriety.”</p>

<p>The English language, written and spoken with propriety, is commonly
called the King’s English.</p>

<p>A monarch, who, three or four generations back, occupied the English
throne, is reported to have said, “If beebles will be boets, they must
sdarve.” This was a rather curious specimen of “King’s English.” It is,
however, a maxim of our law, that “the King can do no wrong.” Whatever bad
English, therefore, may proceed from the royal mouth, is not “King’s
English,” but “Minister’s English,” for which they alone are responsible.
For illustrations of this kind of “English” we beg to refer the reader to
the celebrated English Grammar which was written by the late Mr. Cobbett.</p>

<p>King’s English (or, perhaps, under existing circumstances we should say,
<i>Queen’s</i> English) is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> current coin of conversation, to mutilate
which, and unlawfully to <i>utter</i> the same, is called <i>clipping</i> the King’s
English; a high crime and misdemeanour.</p>

<p>Clipped English, or bad English, is one variety of Comic English, of which
we shall adduce instances hereafter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img03.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center">He’s only a little “prodigy” of mine, Doctor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Slipslop, or the erroneous substitution of one word for another, as
“prodigy” for “protégée,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> “derangement” for “arrangement,” “exasperate”
for “aspirate,” and the like, is another.</p>

<p>Slang, which consists in cant words and phrases, as “dodge” for “sly
trick,” “no go” for “failure,” and “carney” “to flatter,” may be
considered a third.</p>

<p>Latinised English, or Fine English, sometimes assumes the character of
Comic English, especially when applied to the purposes of common
discourse; as “Extinguish the luminary,” “Agitate the communicator,” “Are
your corporeal functions in a condition of salubrity?” “A sable visual
orb,” “A sanguinary nasal protuberance.”</p>

<p>American English is Comic English in a “<i>pretty particular considerable
tarnation</i>” degree.</p>

<p>Among the various kinds of Comic English it would be “<i>tout-à-fait</i>”
inexcusable, were we to “<i>manquer</i>” to mention one which has, so to speak,
quite “<i>bouleversé</i>’d” the old-fashioned style of conversation;
French-English, that is what “<i>nous voulons dire</i>.” “<i>Avec un poco</i>” of
the “<i>Italiano</i>,” this forms what is also called the Mosaic dialect.</p>

<p>English Grammar is divided into four parts&mdash;Orthography, Etymology,
Syntax, and Prosody; and as these are points that a good grammarian always
stands upon, he, particularly when a pedant, and consequently somewhat
<i>flat</i>, may very properly be compared to a table.</p>

<h2>PART I.<br />ORTHOGRAPHY.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER. I.</h3>
<p class="title">OF THE NATURE OF THE LETTERS, AND OF A COMIC ALPHABET.</p>


<p>Orthography is like a junior usher, or instructor of youth. It teaches us
the nature and powers of letters and the right method of spelling words.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;In a public school, the person corresponding to an usher is
called a master. As it is sometimes his duty to flog, we propose that he
should henceforth be called the “Usher of the Birch Rod.”</p>

<p>Comic Orthography teaches us the oddity and absurdities of <i>letters</i>, and
the wrong method of spelling words. The following is an example of Comic
Orthography:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>Now, to proceed with Orthography, we may remark, that</p>

<p>A letter is the least part of a word.</p>

<p>Of a <i>comic letter</i> an instance has already been given.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson’s letter to Lord Chesterfield is a capital letter.</p>

<p>The letters of the Alphabet are the representatives of articulate sounds.</p>

<p>The Alphabet is a Republic of Letters.</p>

<p>There are many things in this world erroneously as well as vulgarly
compared to “bricks.” In the case of the letters of the Alphabet, however,
the comparison is just; they constitute the fabric of a language, and
grammar is the mortar. The wonder is that there should be so few of them.
The English letters are twenty-six in number. There is nothing like
beginning at the beginning; and we shall now therefore enumerate them,
with the view also of rendering their insertion subsidiary to mythological
instruction, in conformity with the plan on which some account of the
Heathen Deities and ancient heroes is prefixed or subjoined to a
Dictionary. We present the reader with a form of Alphabet composed in
humble imitation of that famous one, which, while appreciable by the
dullest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> taste, and level to the meanest capacity, is nevertheless that by
which the greatest minds have been agreeably inducted into knowledge.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 4em;">THE ALPHABET.</span></p>

<p>A was Apollo, the god of the carol,<br />
B stood for Bacchus, astride on his barrel;<br />
C for good Ceres, the goddess of grist,<br />
D was Diana, that wouldn’t be kiss’d;<br />
E was nymph Echo, that pined to a sound,<br />
F was sweet Flora, with buttercups crown’d;<br />
G was Jove’s pot-boy, young Ganymede hight,<br />
H was fair Hebe, his barmaid so tight;<br />
I, little Io, turn’d into a cow,<br />
J, jealous Juno, that spiteful old sow;<br />
K was Kitty, more lovely than goddess or muse;<br />
L, Lacooon&mdash;I wouldn’t have been in <i>his</i> shoes!<br />

P, Parnassus, Apollo hung out on its top;<br />
Q stood for Quirites, the Romans, to wit;<br />
R, for rantipole Roscius, that made such a hit;<br />
S, for Sappho, so famous for felo-de-se,<br />
T, for Thales the wise, F.R.S. and M.D.:<br />

Z was Zeno the Stoic, Zenobia the clever,<br />
And Zoilus the critic, Victoria for ever!</p></div>

<p>Letters are divided into Vowels and Consonants.</p>

<p>The vowels are capable of being perfectly uttered by themselves. They are,
as it were, independent members of the Alphabet, and like independent
members elsewhere form a small minority. The vowels are <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>,
<i>o</i>, <i>u</i>, and sometimes <i>w</i> and <i>y</i>.</p>

<p>An I. O. U. is a more pleasant thing to have, than it is to give.</p>

<p>A blow in the stomach is very likely to W up.</p>

<p>W is a consonant when it begins a word, as “Wicked Will Wiggins whacked
his wife with a whip;” but in every other place it is a vowel, as
crawling, drawling, sawney, screwing, Jew. Y follows the same rule.</p>

<p>A consonant is an articulate sound; but, like an old bachelor, if it exist
alone it exists to no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> purpose. It cannot be perfectly uttered without the
aid of a vowel; and even then the vowel has the greatest share in the
production of the sound. Thus a vowel joined to a consonant becomes, so to
speak, a “better half:” or at all events very strongly resembles one.</p>

<p>Consonants are divided into mutes and semi-vowels.</p>

<p>The mutes cannot be sounded <i>at all</i> without the aid of a vowel. Like
young ladies just “come out,” they are silent as long as you let them
alone. Some have compared them, on account of their name, to the “Original
Good Woman;” but how joining her to anything except to her head again
would have cured her of her dumbness, it is not easy to see. <i>B</i>, <i>p</i>,
<i>t</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>k</i>, and <i>c</i> and <i>g</i> hard, are the letters called mutes, or, as
some have denominated them, <i>black letters</i>.</p>

<p>The semi-vowels, which are <i>f</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>z</i>,
and <i>c</i> and <i>g</i> soft, have an imperfect sound of themselves. Well! half a
loaf is better than no bread.</p>

<p><i>L</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>r</i>, are further distinguished by the name of liquids. Like
certain other liquids they are good for mixing, that is to say, they
readily unite with other consonants; and flow, as it were, into their
sounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>The specific gravity of liquids can only be rendered amusing by comical
<i>figures</i>. The gravity, too, of a <i>solid</i> is generally the more ludicrous.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img05.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center"><small>MUTES AND LIQUIDS.</small></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>A diphthong is the union of two vowels in one sound, as <i>ea</i> in heavy,
<i>eu</i> in Meux, <i>ou</i> in stout.</p>

<p>A triphthong is a similar union of three vowels, as <i>eau</i> in the word
beau; a term applied to dandies, and addressed to geese: probably because
they are birds of a feather.</p>

<p>A proper diphthong is that in which the sound is formed by both the
vowels: as, <i>aw</i> in awkward, <i>ou</i> in lout.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img06.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>An improper diphthong is that in which the sound is formed by one of the
vowels only, as <i>ea</i> in heartless, <i>oa</i> in hoax.</p>

<p>According to our notions there are a great many improper diphthongs in
common use. By improper diphthongs <i>we</i> mean vowels unwarrantably dilated
into diphthongs, and diphthongs mispronounced, in defiance of good
English, and against our Sovereign Lady the Queen, her crown and dignity.</p>

<p>For instance, the rustics say,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Loor! whaut a foine gaal! Moy oy!”</p>

<p>“Whaut a precious soight of crows!”</p>

<p>“As I was a comin’ whoam through the corn fiddles (fields) I met Willum
Jones.”</p>

<p>After this manner cockneys express themselves:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I sor (saw) him.”</p>

<p>“Dror (draw) it out.”</p>

<p>“Hold your jor (jaw).”</p>

<p>“I caun’t. You shaun’t. How’s your Maw and Paw? Do you like taut (tart)?”</p>

<p>We have heard young ladies remark,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, my! What a naice young man!”</p>

<p>“What a bee&mdash;eautiful day!”</p>

<p>“I’m so fond of dayncing!”</p>

<p>Dandies frequently exclaim,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>“I’m postively tiawed (tired).”</p>

<p>“What a sweet tempaw! (temper).”</p>

<p>“How daughty (dirty) the streets au!”</p>

<p>And they also call,&mdash;</p>

<p>Literature, “literetchah.”</p>

<p>Perfectly, “pawfacly.”</p>

<p>Disgusted, “disgasted.”</p>

<p>Sky (theatrical dandies do this chiefly) “ske-eye.”</p>

<p>Blue, “ble&mdash;ew.”</p>

<p>We might here insert a few remarks on the nature of the human voice, and
of the mechanism by means of which articulation is performed; but besides
our dislike to prolixity, we are afraid of getting <i>down in the mouth</i>,
and thereby going the <i>wrong way</i> to please our readers. We may
nevertheless venture to invite attention to a few comical peculiarities in
connection with articulate sounds.</p>

<p>Ahem! at the commencement of a speech, is a sound agreeably droll.</p>

<p>The vocal comicalities of the infant in arms are exceedingly laughable,
but we are unfortunately unable to spell them.</p>

<p>The articulation of the Jew is peculiarly ridiculous. The “peoplesh” are
badly spoken of, and not well spoken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>Bawling, croaking, hissing, whistling, and grunting, are elegant vocal
accomplishments.</p>

<p>Lisping, as, “thweet, Dthooliur, thawming, kweechau,” is by some
considered interesting, by others absurd.</p>

<p>Stammering is sometimes productive of amusement.</p>

<p>Humming and hawing are ludicrous embellishments to a discourse. Crowing
like a cock, braying like a donkey, <i>quacking</i> like a duck, and hooting
like an owl, are modes of exerting the voice which are usually regarded as
diverting.</p>

<p>But of all the sounds which proceed from the human mouth, by far the
funniest are Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;Ho! ho! ho! and He! he! he!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p class="title">OF SYLLABLES.</p>


<p>Syllable is a nice word, it sounds so much like syllabub!</p>

<p>A syllable, whether it constitute a word or part of a word, is a sound,
either simple or compound, produced by one effort of the voice, as, “O!,
what, a, lark!&mdash;Here, we, are!”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img08.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>Spelling is the art of putting together the letters which compose a
syllable, or the syllables which compose a word.</p>

<p>Comic spelling is usually the work of imagination. The chief rule to be
observed in this kind of spelling, is, to spell every word as it is
pronounced; though the rule is not universally observed by comic spellers.
The following example, for the genuineness of which we can vouch, is one
so singularly apposite, that although we have already submitted a similar
specimen of orthography to the reader, we are irresistibly tempted to make
a second experiment on his indulgence. The epistolary curiosity, then,
which we shall now proceed to transcribe, was addressed by a patient to
his medical adviser.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Clearkenwell”</span></p></div>

<p>Chelsea College has been supposed by foreigners to be an institution for
the teaching of orthography; probably in consequence of a passage in the
well known song in “The Waterman,”</p>

<p class="poem">“Never more at Chelsea Ferry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shall your Thomas take a <i>spell</i>.”</span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Why is a dunce no conjuror?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Because he cannot <i>spell</i>.</p>

<p>Among the various kinds of spelling may be enumerated spelling for a
favour; or giving what is called a broad hint.</p>

<p>Certain rules for the division of words into syllables are laid down in
some grammars, and we should be very glad to follow the established usage,
but, limited as we are by considerations of comicality and space, we
cannot afford to give more than two very general directions. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> do
not know how to spell a word, look it out in the dictionary, and if you
have no dictionary by you, write the word in such a way, that, while it
may be guessed at, it shall not be legible.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p class="title">OF WORDS IN GENERAL.</p>


<p>There is no one question that we are aware of more puzzling than this,
“What is your opinion of <i>things</i> in general?” <i>Words</i> in general are,
fortunately for us, a subject on which the formation of an opinion is
somewhat more easy. Words stand for things: they are a sort of counters,
checks, bank-notes, and sometimes, indeed, they are <i>notes</i> for which
people get a great deal of money. Such words, however, are, alas! not
English words, or words sterling. Strange! that so much should be given
for a mere song. It is quite clear that the givers, whatever may be their
pretensions to a refined or literary taste, must be entirely unacquainted
with <i>Words</i>worth.</p>

<p>Fine words are oily enough, and he who uses them is vulgarly said to “cut
it fat;” but for all that it is well known that they will not butter
parsnips.</p>

<p>Some say that words are but wind: for this reason, when people are having
words, it is often said, that “the wind’s up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>Different words please different people. Philosophers are fond of hard
words; pedants of tough words, long words, and crackjaw words; bullies, of
rough words; boasters, of big words; the rising generation, of slang
words; fashionable people, of French words; wits, of sharp words and smart
words; and ladies, of nice words, sweet words, soft words, and soothing
words; and, indeed, of words in general.</p>

<p>Words (when spoken) are articulate sounds used by common consent as signs
of our ideas.</p>

<p>A word of one syllable is called a Monosyllable: as, you, are, a, great,
oaf.</p>

<p>A word of two syllables is named a Dissyllable; as, cat-gut, mu-sic.</p>

<p>A word of three syllables is termed a Trisyllable; as, Mag-net-ism,
Mum-mer-y.</p>

<p>A word of four or more syllables is entitled a Polysyllable; as,
in-ter-mi-na-ble, cir-cum-lo-cu-ti-on, ex-as-pe-ra-ted, func-ti-o-na-ry,
met-ro-po-li-tan, ro-tun-di-ty.</p>

<p>Words of more syllables than one are sometimes comically contracted into
one syllable; as, in s’pose for suppose, b’lieve for believe, and ’scuse
for excuse: here, perhaps, ’buss, abbreviated from omnibus, deserves to be
mentioned.</p>

<p>In like manner, many long words are elegantly trimmed and shortened; as,
ornary for ordinary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> ’strornary for extraordinary, and curosity for
curiosity; to which mysterus for mysterious may also be added.</p>

<p>Polysyllables are an essential element in the sublime, both in poetry and
in prose; but especially in that species of the sublime which borders very
closely on the ridiculous; as,</p>

<p class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 7em;">“Aldiborontiphoscophormio,</span><br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>All words are either primitive or derivative. A primitive word is that
which cannot be reduced to any simpler word in the language; as, brass,
York, knave. A derivative word, under the head of which compound words are
also included, is that which may be reduced to another and a more simple
word in the English language; as, brazen, Yorkshire, knavery, mud-lark,
lighterman.</p>

<p>Broadbrim is a derivative word; but it is one often applied to a very
<i>primitive</i> kind of person.</p>

<h2>PART II.<br />ETYMOLOGY.</h2>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p class="title">A COMICAL VIEW OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH.</p>


<p>Etymology teaches the varieties, modifications, and derivation of words.</p>

<p>The derivation of words means that which they come from <i>as words</i>; for
what they come from as <i>sounds</i>, is another matter. Some words come from
the heart, and then they are pathetic; others from the nose, in which case
they are ludicrous. The funniest place, however, from which words can
come, is the stomach. By the way, the Lord Mayor would do well to keep a
ventriloquist, from whom, at a moment’s notice, he might ascertain the
voice of the corporation.</p>

<p>Comic Etymology teaches us the varieties, modifications, and derivation,
of words invested with a comic character.</p>

<p>Grammatically speaking, we say that there are, in English, as many sorts
of words as a cat is said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> to have lives, nine; namely, the Article, the
Substantive or Noun, the Adjective, the Pronoun, the Verb, the Adverb, the
Preposition, the Conjunction, and the Interjection.</p>

<p>Comically speaking, there are a great many sorts of words which we have
not room enough to particularise individually. We can therefore only
afford to classify them. For instance; there are words which are spoken in
the <i>Low Countries</i>, and are <i>High Dutch</i> to persons of quality; as in
Billingsgate, Whitechapel, and St. Giles’s.</p>

<p>Words in use amongst all those who have to do with horses.</p>

<p>Words that pass between rival cab-men.</p>

<p>Words peculiar to the P. R. where the order of the day is generally a word
and a blow.</p>

<p>Words spoken in a state of intoxication.</p>

<p>Words uttered under excitement.</p>

<p>Words of endearment, addressed to children in arms.</p>

<p>Similar words, sometimes called burning, tender, soft, and broken words,
addressed to young ladies, and whispered, lisped, sighed, or drawled,
according to circumstances.</p>

<p>Words of honour; as, tailors’ words and shoemakers’ words; which, like the
above-mentioned, or lovers’ words, are very often broken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>With many other sorts of words, which will be readily suggested by the
reader’s fancy.</p>

<p>But now let us go on with the parts of speech.</p>

<p>1. An Article is a word prefixed to substantives to point them out, and to
show the extent of their meaning; as, <i>a</i> dandy, <i>an</i> ape, <i>the</i>
simpleton.</p>

<p>One kind of comic article is otherwise denominated an oddity, or queer
article.</p>

<p>Another kind of comic article is often to be met with in Bentley’s
Miscellany.</p>

<p>2. A Substantive or Noun is the name of anything that exists, or of which
we have any notion; as, <i>tinker</i>, <i>tailor</i>, <i>soldier</i>, <i>sailor</i>,
<i>apothecary</i>, <i>ploughboy</i>, <i>thief</i>.</p>

<p>Now the above definition of a substantive is Lindley Murray’s, not ours.
We mention this, because we have an objection, though, not, perhaps, a
serious one, to urge against it; for, in the first place, we have “no
notion” of impudence, and yet impudence is a substantive; and, in the
second, we invite attention to the following piece of Logic,</p>

<p class="poem">A substantive is something,<br />
But nothing is a substantive;<br />
Therefore, nothing is something.</p>

<p>A substantive may generally be known by its taking an article before it,
and by its making sense of itself: as, a <i>treat</i>, the <i>mulligrubs</i>, an
<i>ache</i>.</p>

<p>3. An Adjective is a word joined to a substantive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> to denote its quality;
as a <i>ragged</i> regiment, an <i>odd</i> set.</p>

<p>You may distinguish an adjective by its making sense with the word thing:
as, a <i>poor</i> thing, a <i>sweet</i> thing, a <i>cool</i> thing; or with any
particular substantive, as a <i>ticklish</i> position, an <i>awkward</i> mistake, a
<i>strange</i> step.</p>

<p>4. A Pronoun is a word used in lieu of a noun, in order to avoid
tautology: as, “The man wants calves; <i>he</i> is a lath; <i>he</i> is a
walking-stick.”</p>

<p>5. A Verb is a word which signifies to be, to do, or to suffer: as, I am;
I calculate; I am fixed.</p>

<p>A verb may usually be distinguished by its making sense with a personal
pronoun, or with the word <i>to</i> before it: as I <i>yell</i>, he <i>grins</i>, they
<i>caper</i>; or to <i>drink</i>, to <i>smoke</i>, to <i>chew</i>.</p>

<p>Fashionable accomplishments!</p>

<p>Certain substantives are, with peculiar elegance, and by persons who call
themselves <i>genteel</i>, converted into verbs: as, “Do you <i>wine</i>?” “Will you
<i>malt</i>?” “Let me persuade you to <i>cheese</i>?”</p>

<p>6. An Adverb is a part of speech which, joined to a verb, an adjective, or
another adverb, serves to express some quality or circumstance concerning
it: as, “She swears <i>dreadfully</i>; she is <i>incorrigibly</i> lazy; and she is
<i>almost continually</i> in liquor.”</p>

<p>7. An adverb is generally characterised by answering to the question, How?
how much? when?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> or where? as in the verse, “<i>Merrily</i> danced the
Quaker’s wife,” the answer to the question, How did she dance? is,
merrily.</p>

<p>8. Prepositions serve to connect words together, and to show the relation
between them: as,</p>

<p>“Off <i>with</i> his head, so much <i>for</i> Buckingham!”</p>

<p>9. A Conjunction is used to connect not only words, but sentences also:
as, Smith <i>and</i> Jones are happy <i>because</i> they are single. A miss is <i>as</i>
good <i>as</i> a mile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img10.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center"><small>SINGLE BLESSEDNESS.</small></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>10. An Interjection is a short word denoting passion or emotion: as,
“<i>Oh</i>, Sophonisba! Sophonisba, <i>oh</i>!” Pshaw! Pish! Pooh! Bah! Ah! Au!
Eughph! Yah! Hum! Ha! Lauk! La! Lor! Heigho! Well! There! &amp;c.</p>

<p>Among the foregoing interjections there may, perhaps, be some unhonoured
by the adoption of genius, and unknown in the domains of literature. For
the present notice of them some apology may be required, but little will
be given; their insertion may excite astonishment, but their omission
would have provoked complaint: though unprovided with a Johnsonian title
to a place in the English vocabulary, they have long been recognised by
the popular voice; and let it be remembered, that as custom supplies the
defects of legislation, so that which is not sanctioned by magisterial
authority may nevertheless be justified by vernacular usage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p class="title">OF THE ARTICLES.</p>


<p>The Articles in English are two, <i>a</i> and <i>the</i>; <i>a</i> becomes <i>an</i> before a
vowel, and before an <i>h</i> which is not sounded: as, <i>an</i> exquisite, <i>an</i>
hour-glass. But if the <i>h</i> be pronounced, the <i>a</i> only is used: as, <i>a</i>
homicide, <i>a</i> homœopathist, <i>a</i> hum.</p>

<p>This rule is reversed in what is termed the Cockney dialect: as, <i>a</i>
inspector, <i>a</i> officer, <i>a</i> object, <i>a</i> omnibus, <i>a</i> individual, <i>a</i>
alderman, <i>a</i> honour, <i>an</i> horse, or rather, a <i>norse</i>, <i>an</i> hound, <i>an</i>
hunter, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is usual in the same dialect, when the article <i>an</i> should, in strict
propriety, precede a word, to omit the letter <i>n</i>, and further, for the
sake of euphony and elegance, to place the aspirate <i>h</i> before the word;
as, a <i>h</i>egg, a <i>h</i>accident, a <i>h</i>adverb, a <i>h</i>ox. But sometimes, when a
word begins with an <i>h</i>, and has the article <i>a</i> before it, the aspirate
is omitted, the letter <i>a</i> remaining unchanged: as, a ’ogg, a ’edge, a
’emisphere, a ’ouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>The slight liberties which it is the privilege of the people to take with
the article and aspirate become always most evident in the expression of
excited feeling, when the stress which is laid upon certain words is
heightened by the peculiarity of the pronunciation: as, “You <i>h</i>ignorant
<i>h</i>upstart! you <i>h</i>illiterate ’og! ’ow dare you to <i>h</i>offer such a
<i>h</i>insult to my <i>h</i>understanding?&mdash;You are a <i>h</i>object of contempt, you
<i>h</i>are, and a <i>h</i>insolent <i>w</i>agobond! your mother was nothing but a
<i>h</i>apple-woman, and your father was an ’uckster!”</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;In the above example, the ordinary rules of language relative to
the article and aspirate (to say nothing of the maxims of politeness) are
completely set at nought; but it must be remembered, that in common
discourse the modification of the article, and the omission or use of the
aspirate, are determined by the Cockneys according to the ease with which
particular words are pronounced; as, “Though <i>h</i>impudent, he warn’t as
<i>i</i>mpudent as Bill wur.” Here the word <i>impudent</i>, following a
vowel-sound, is most easily pronounced as <i>h</i>impudent, while the same
word, coming after a consonant, even in the same sentence, is uttered with
greater facility in the usual way.</p>

<p><i>A</i> or <i>an</i> is called the indefinite article, because it is used, in a
vague sense, to point out some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> thing belonging to a certain kind, but
in other respects indeterminate; as,</p>

<p>“<i>A</i> horse, <i>a</i> horse, my kingdom for <i>a</i> horse!”</p>

<p>So say grammarians. Eating-house keepers tell a different story. A cheese,
in common discourse, means an object of a certain shape, size, weight, and
so on, entire and perfect; so that to call half a cheese a cheese, would
constitute a flaw in an indictment against a thief who had stolen one. But
a waiter will term a fraction, or a modicum of cheese, <i>a</i> cheese; a
plate-full of pudding, <i>a</i> pudding; and <i>a</i> stick of celery, a celery, or
rather, a <i>salary</i>. Nay, he will even apply the article <i>a</i> to a word
which does not stand for an individual object at all; as <i>a</i> bread, <i>a</i>
butter, <i>a</i> bacon. Here we are reminded of the famous exclamation of one
of these gentry:&mdash;“Master! master! there’s two teas and a brandy-and-water
just hopped over the palings!”</p>

<p><i>The</i> is termed the definite article, inasmuch as it denotes what
particular thing or things are meant; as,</p>

<p class="poem">“<i>The</i> miller he stole corn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>The</i> weaver he stole yarn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And <i>the</i> little tailòr he stole broad-cloth</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To keep <i>the</i> three rogues warm.”</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>A substantive to which no article is prefixed is taken in a general sense;
as, “Apple sauce is proper for goose;” that is, for all geese.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img11.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center"><small>APPLE-SAUCE.</small></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few additional remarks may advantageously be made with respect to the
articles. The mere substitution of the definite for the indefinite article
is capable of changing entirely the meaning of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> sentence. “That is <i>a</i>
ticket” is the assertion of a certain fact; but “That is <i>the</i> ticket!”
means something which is quite different.</p>

<p>The article is not prefixed to a proper name; as, Stubbs, Wiggins, Chubb,
or Hobson, except for the sake of distinguishing a particular family, or
description of persons; as, He is <i>a</i> Burke; that is, one of the Burkes,
or <i>a</i> person resembling Burke. The article is sometimes also prefixed to
a proper name, to point out some distinguished individual; as, <i>The</i>
Burke, or the great politician, or the resurrectionist, Burke.</p>

<p>Who is <i>the</i> Smith?</p>

<p>The indefinite article is joined to substantives in the singular number
only. We have heard people say, however, “He keeps <i>a</i> wine-vaults;” or,
to quote more correctly&mdash;waltz. The definite article may be joined to
plurals also.</p>

<p>The definite article is frequently used with adverbs in the comparative
and superlative degree: as, “<i>The</i> longer I live, <i>the</i> broader I grow;”
or, as we have all heard the showman say, “This here, gentlemen and
ladies, is the vonderful heagle of the sun; <i>the</i> ’otterer it grows, <i>the</i>
higherer he flies!”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SECTION I.</p>

<p class="center">OF SUBSTANTIVES IN GENERAL.</p>

<p>Substantives are either proper or common.</p>

<p>Proper names, or substantives, are the names belonging to individuals: as
William, Birmingham.</p>

<p>These are sometimes converted into nicknames, or <i>im</i>proper names: as
Bill, Brummagem.</p>

<p>Common names, or substantives, denote kinds containing many sorts, or
sorts containing many individuals under them: as brute, beast, bumpkin,
cherub, infant, goblin, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Proper names, when an article is prefixed to them, are employed as common
names: as, “They thought him a perfect <i>Chesterfield</i>; he quite astonished
the <i>Browns</i>.”</p>

<p>Common names, on the other hand, are made to denote individuals, by the
addition of articles or pronouns: as,</p>

<p>“There was <i>a</i> little man, and he had <i>a</i> little gun.”</p>

<p>“<i>That</i> boy will be the death of me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>Substantives are considered according to gender, number, and case; they
are all of the third person when spoken <i>of</i>, and of the second when
spoken <i>to</i>: as,</p>

<p class="poem">Matilda, fairest maid, who art<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In countless bumpers toasted,</span><br />
O let thy pity baste the heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy fatal charms have roasted!</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img12.jpg" alt="" /></p>


<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">SECTION II.</p>
<p class="center">OF GENDER.</p>

<p>The distinction between nouns with regard to sex is called Gender. There
are three genders; the Masculine, the Feminine, and the Neuter.</p>

<p>The masculine gender belongs to animals of the male kind: as, a fop, a
jackass, a boar, a poet, a lion.</p>

<p>The feminine gender is peculiar to animals of the female kind: as, a
poetess, a lioness, a goose.</p>

<p>The neuter gender is that of objects which are neither males nor females:
as, a toast, a tankard, a pot, a pipe, a pudding, a pie, a sausage, a
roll, a muffin, a crumpet, a puff, a cheesecake, a bun, an apricot, an
orange, a lollipop, a cream, an ice, a jelly, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>We might go on to enumerate an infinity of objects of the neuter gender,
of all sorts and kinds; but in the selection of the foregoing examples we
have been guided by two considerations:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The desire of exciting agreeable emotions in the mind of the reader.</p>

<p>2. The wish to illustrate the following proposition, “That almost
everything nice is also neuter.”</p>

<p>Except, however, a nice young lady, a nice duck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> and one or two other
nice things, which we do not at present remember.</p>

<p>Some neuter substantives are by a figure of speech converted into the
masculine or feminine gender: thus we say of the sun, that when <i>he</i>
shines upon a Socialist, he shines upon a thief; and of the moon, that she
affects the minds of lovers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img13.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center"><small>A SOCIALIST.</small></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are certain nouns with which notions of strength, vigour, and the
like qualities, are more particularly connected; and these are the neuter
substantives which are figuratively rendered masculine. On the other hand,
beauty, amiability, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> so forth, are held to invest words with a
feminine character. Thus the sun is said to be masculine, and the moon
feminine. But for our own part, and our view is confirmed by the
discoveries of astronomy, we believe that the sun is called masculine from
his supporting and sustaining the moon, and finding her the wherewithal
to shine away as she does of a night, when all quiet people are in bed;
and from his being obliged to keep such a family of stars besides. The
moon, we think, is accounted feminine, because she is thus maintained and
kept up in her splendour, like a fine lady, by her husband the sun.
Furthermore, the moon is continually changing; on which account alone she
might be referred to the feminine gender. The earth is feminine, tricked
out, as she is, with gems and flowers. Cities and towns are likewise
feminine, because there are as many windings, turnings, and little odd
corners in them as there are in the female mind. A ship is feminine,
inasmuch as she is blown about by every wind. Virtue is feminine by
courtesy. Fortune and <i>mis</i>fortune, like mother and daughter, are both
feminine. The Church is feminine, because she is married to the state; or
married to the state because she is feminine&mdash;we do not know which. Time
is masculine, because he is so trifled with by the ladies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img14.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center">“Shan’t I shine to-night, dear?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The English language distinguishes the sex in three manners; namely,</p>

<p>1. By different words; as,</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">

<p>And several other</p>

<p class="poem">Words we don’t mention,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Pray pardon the crime,)</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But wanting in rhyme.</span></p>

<p>2. By a difference of termination; as,</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">

    <td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td>

    <td>Poetess.</td></tr>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">

    <td>A she-bear (like Queen Bess).</td></tr>
<tr><td>A male flirt (a rare animal).</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>A female flirt (a common animal).</td></tr></table>

<p>We have heard it said, that every Jack has his Jill. That may be; but it
is by no means true that every cock has his hen; for there is a</p>

<p class="poem">Cock-swain, but no Hen-swain.<br />
Cock-eye, but no Hen-eye.<br />
Cock-ade, but no Hen-ade.<br />
Cock-atrice, but no Hen-atrice.<br />
Cock-horse, but no Hen-horse.<br />
Cock-ney, but no Hen-ney.</p>

<p>Then we have a weather-cock, but no weather-hen; a turn-cock, but no
turn-hen; and many a jolly cock, but not one jolly hen; unless we except
some of those by whom their mates are pecked.</p>

<p>Some words; as, parent, child, cousin, friend, neighbour, servant, and
several others, are either male or female, according to circumstances. The
word blue (used as a substantive) is one of this class.</p>

<p>It is a great pity that our language is so poor in the terminations that
denote gender. Were we to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> say of a woman, that she is a rogue, a knave, a
scamp, or a vagabond, we feel that we should use, not only strong but
improper expressions. Yet we have no corresponding terms to apply, in case
of necessity, to the female. Why is this? Doubtless because we never want
them. For the same reason, our forefathers transmitted to us the words,
philosopher, astronomer, philologer, and so forth, without any feminine
equivalent. Alas! for the wisdom of our ancestors! They never calculated
on the March of Intellect.</p>

<p>We understand that it is in contemplation to coin a new word, <i>memberess</i>;
it being confidently expected that by the time the new Houses of
Parliament are finished, the progress of civilisation will have furnished
us with female representatives.</p>

<p>In that case the House will be an assembly of <i>Speakers</i>.</p>

<p>But if all the old women are to be turned out of St. Stephen’s, and their
places to be filled with young ones, the nation will hardly be a loser by
the change.</p>

<p>Number is the consideration of an object as one or more; as, one <i>poet</i>,
two, three, four, five <i>poets</i>; and so on, ad infinitum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>Other countries may reckon up as many poets as they please; England has
<i>one more</i>.</p>

<p>The singular number expresses one object only; as, a towel, a viper.</p>

<p>The plural signifies more objects than one; as, towels, vipers.</p>

<p>Some nouns are used only in the singular number; dirt, pitch, tallow,
grease, filth, butter, asparagus, &amp;c.; others only in the plural; as,
galligaskins, breeches, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Some words are the same in both numbers; as, sheep, swine, and some
others.</p>

<p class="poem">“A doctor, both to sheep and swine,”<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Said Mrs. Glass, “I am;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For legs of mutton I can <i>dress</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And shine in <i>curing</i> ham.”</span></p>

<p>The plural number of nouns is usually formed by adding s to the singular;
as, dove, doves, love, loves, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="poem">Julia, <i>dove</i> returns to <i>dove</i>,<br />
Quid pro quo, and <i>love</i> for <i>love</i>;<br />
Happy in our mutual <i>loves</i>,<br />
Let us live like turtle <i>doves</i>!</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img15.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When, however, the substantive singular ends in x, ch <i>soft</i>, sh, ss, or
s, we add es in the plural.</p>

<p class="poem">But remember, though box<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the plural makes boxes,</span><br />
That the plural of ox<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should be <i>oxen</i>, not <i>oxes</i>.</span></p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The singular is often used, by a kind of licence conceded to
persons of refinement, for the plural; as, “May I trouble you for <i>a
bean</i>?” “Will you assist Miss Spriggins to <i>a pea</i>?” So also people say,
“A few <i>green</i>.” “Two or three <i>radish</i>,” &amp;c.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SECTION IV.</p>
<p class="center">OF CASE.</p>

<p>There is nearly as much difference between Latin and English substantives,
with respect to the number of cases pertaining to each, as there is
between a quack-doctor and a physician; for while in Latin substantives
have six cases, in English they have but three. But the analogy should
not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> be strained too far; for the fools in the world (who furnish the
quack with his cases) more than double the number of the wise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img16.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center"><small>A VERY BAD CASE.</small></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cases of substantives are these: the Nominative, the Possessive or
Genitive, and the Objective or Accusative.</p>

<p>The Nominative Case merely expresses the name of a thing, or the subject
of the verb: as, “The doctors differ;”&mdash;“The patient dies!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>Possession, which is nine points of the law, is what is signified by the
Possessive Case. This case is distinguished by an apostrophe, with the
letter s subjoined to it: as, “My soul’s idol!”&mdash;“A pudding’s end.”</p>

<p>But when the plural ends in <i>s</i>, the apostrophe only is retained, and the
other <i>s</i> is omitted: as, “The Ministers’ Step;”&mdash;“The Rogues’
March;”&mdash;“Crocodiles’ tears;”&mdash;“Butchers’ mourning.”</p>

<p>When the singular terminates in <i>ss</i>, the letter <i>s</i> is sometimes, in like
manner, dispensed with: as, “For goodness’ sake!”&mdash;“For righteousness’
sake!” Nevertheless, we have no objection to “Guinness’s” Stout.</p>

<p>The Objective Case follows a verb active, and expresses the object of an
action, or of a relation: as, “Spring beat Bill;” that is, Bill or
“William <i>Neate</i>.” Hence, perhaps, the American phrase, “I’ll lick you
<i>elegant</i>.”</p>

<p>By the by, it seems to us, that when the Americans revolted from the
authority of England, they determined also to revolutionise their
language.</p>

<p>The Objective Case is also used with a preposition: as, “You are in a
mess.”</p>

<p>English substantives may be declined in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<p class="title">OF ADJECTIVES.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SECTION I.</p>
<p class="center">OF THE NATURE OF ADJECTIVES AND THE DEGREES OF COMPARISON.</p>

<p>An English Adjective, whatever may be its gender, number, or case, like a
rusty weathercock, never varies. Thus we say, “A certain cabinet; certain
rogues.”</p>

<p>But as a rusty weathercock may vary in being more or less rusty, so an
adjective varies in the degrees of comparison.</p>

<p>The degrees of comparison, like the genders, the Graces, the Fates, the
Kings of Cologne, the Weird Sisters, the Jolly Postboys, and many other
things, are three; the Positive, the Comparative, and the Superlative.</p>

<p>The Positive state simply expresses the quality of an object; as, fat,
ugly, foolish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>The Comparative degree increases or lessens the signification of the
positive; as, fatter, uglier, more foolish, less foolish.</p>

<p>The Superlative degree increases or lessens the positive to the highest or
lowest degree; as, fattest, ugliest, most foolish, least foolish.</p>

<p>Amongst the ancients, Ulysses was the <i>fattest</i>, because nobody could
<i>compass</i> him.</p>

<p>Aristides the Just was the <i>ugliest</i>, because he was so very <i>plain</i>.</p>

<p>The most <i>foolish</i>, undoubtedly, was Homer; for who was more <i>natural</i>
than he?</p>

<p>The positive becomes the comparative by the addition of <i>r</i> or <i>er</i>; and
the superlative by the addition of <i>st</i> or <i>est</i> to the end of it; as,
brown, browner, brownest; stout, stouter, stoutest; heavy, heavier,
heaviest; wet, wetter, wettest. The adverbs <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>, prefixed to
the adjective, also form the superlative degree; as, heavy, more heavy,
most heavy.</p>

<p>Most heavy is the drink of draymen: hence, perhaps, the <i>weight</i> of those
important personages. More of this, however, in our forthcoming work on
Phrenology.</p>

<p>Monosyllables are usually compared by <i>er</i> and <i>est</i>, and dissyllables by
<i>more</i> and <i>most</i>; except dissyllables ending in <i>y</i> or in <i>le</i> before a
mute, or those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> which are accented on the last syllable; for these, like
monosyllables, easily admit of <i>er</i> and <i>est</i>. But these terminations are
scarcely ever used in comparing words of more than two syllables.</p>

<p>We have some words, which, from custom, are irregular in respect of
comparison; as, good, better, best; bad, worse, worst, &amp;c. Much amusement
may be derived from the comparisons of adjectives, as made by natural
grammarians; a class of beings who generally inhabit the kitchen or
stable, but may sometimes be met with in more elevated regions. A few
examples will not be out of place. We are not speaking of <i>servants</i>, but
of degrees of comparison; as,</p>

<p>With many others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>Here also may be adduced the Yankee’s “notion” of comparison; “My uncle’s
a tarnation rogue; but I’m a tarnation<i>er</i>.”</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SECTION II.</p>
<p class="center">A FEW REMARKS ON THE SUBJECT OF COMPARISON.</p>

<p>Comparisons appear to have been strongly disapproved of by Dr. Johnson.
“Sir,” said he, “the Whigs make comparisons.” It must be confessed that
the Doctor’s meaning is not quite so evident here as it is in general; but
that may be the fault of his biographer. Perhaps some of the Whigs had
been making comparisons at his expense, or impertinent comparisons, which
his temper, being <i>positive</i>, may have tempted them to indulge in. Or they
may have been <i>out</i> in making their comparisons, which, in that case, must
of course have been bad. But a truce to speculations of this kind, on the
saying of one, another of whose dogmas was, that “the man who could make a
pun would also pick a pocket.” We only hope, that such comparisons as we
may make, will no more vex his spirit now than they would once have
aroused his bile.</p>

<p>Lindley Murray judiciously observes, that “if we consider the subject of
comparison attentively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> we shall perceive that the degrees of it are
infinite in number, or at least indefinite:” and he proceeds to say, “A
mountain is larger than a mite; by how many degrees? How much bigger is
the earth than a grain of sand? By how many degrees was Socrates wiser
than Alcibiades? or by how many is snow whiter than this paper? It is
plain,” quoth Lindley, “that to these and the like questions no definite
answers can be returned.”</p>

<p>No; but an impertinent one may. Ask the first charity-boy you meet any one
of them, and see if he does not immediately respond, “Ax my eye;” or, “As
much again as half.”</p>

<p>But when quantity can be exactly measured, the degrees of excess may be
exactly ascertained. A foot is just twelve times as long as an inch; a
tailor is nine times less than a man.</p>

<p>Moreover, to compensate for the indefiniteness of the degrees of
comparison, we use certain adverbs and words of like import, whereby we
render our meaning tolerably intelligible; as, “Byron was a <i>much</i> greater
poet than Muggins.” “Honey is <i>a great deal</i> sweeter than wax.” “Sugar is
<i>considerably</i> more pleasant than the cane.” “Maria says, that Dick the
butcher is <i>by far</i> the most killing young man she knows.”</p>

<p>The words very, exceedingly, and the like, placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> before the positive,
give it the force of the superlative; and this is called by some the
superlative of eminence, as distinguished from the superlative of
comparison. Thus, Very Reverend is termed the superlative of eminence,
although it is the title of a dean, not of a cardinal; and Most Reverend,
the appellation of an Archbishop, is called the superlative of comparison.</p>

<p>A <i>Bishop</i>, in our opinion, is <i>Most Excellent</i>.</p>

<p>The comparative is sometimes so employed as to express the same
pre-eminence or inferiority as the superlative. For instance; the
sentence, “Of all the cultivators of science, the botanist is the most
crafty,” has the same meaning as the following “The botanist is more
crafty than any other cultivator of science.”</p>

<p>Why? some of our readers will ask&mdash;</p>

<p>Because he is acquainted with all sorts of <i>plants</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>
<p class="title">OF PRONOUNS.</p>


<p>Pronouns or proxy-nouns are of three kinds; namely, the Personal, the
Relative, and the Adjective Pronouns.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;That when we said, some few pages back, that a pronoun was a word
used instead of a noun, we did not mean to call such words as thingumibob,
whatsiname, what-d’ye-call-it, and the like, pronouns.</p>

<p>And that, although we shall proceed to treat of the pronouns in the
English language, we shall have nothing to do, at present, with what some
people please to call pronoun-<i>ciation</i>.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SECTION I.</p>
<p class="center">OF THE PERSONAL PRONOUNS.</p>

<p>“Mr. Haddams, don’t be personal, Sir!”</p>

<p>“I’m not, Sir.”</p>

<p>“You har, Sir!”</p>

<p>“What did I say, Sir?&mdash;tell me that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>“You reflected on my perfession, Sir; you said, as there was <i>some</i> people
as always stuck up for the <i>cloth</i>; and you insinnivated that certain
parties dined off <i>goose</i> by means of <i>cabbaging</i> from the parish. I ask
any gentleman in the westry, if that an’t personal?”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img17.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center"><small>A SELECT VESTRY.</small></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>“Vell, Sir, vot I says I’ll stick to.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir, like vax, as the saying is.”</p>

<p>“Wot d’ye mean by that, Sir?”</p>

<p>“Wot I say, Sir!”</p>

<p>“You’re a individual, Sir!”</p>

<p>“You’re another, Sir!”</p>

<p>“You’re no gentleman, Sir!”</p>

<p>“You’re a humbug, Sir!”</p>

<p>“You’re a knave, Sir!”</p>

<p>“You’re a rogue, Sir!”</p>

<p>“You’re a wagabond, Sir!”</p>

<p>“You’re a willain, Sir!”</p>

<p>“You’re a tailor, Sir!”</p>

<p>“You’re a cobbler, Sir!” (Order! order! chair! chair! &amp;c.)</p>

<p>The above is what is called personal language. How many different things
one word serves to express in English! A pronoun may be as personal as
possible, and yet nobody will take offence at it.</p>

<p>There are five Personal Pronouns; namely, I, thou, he, she, it; with their
plurals, we, ye or you, they.</p>

<p>Personal Pronouns admit of person, number, gender, and case.</p>

<p>Pronouns have three persons in each number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>In the Singular;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I, is the first person.</p>

<p>Thou, is the second person.</p>

<p>He, she, or it, is the third person.</p></div>

<p>In the plural;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We, is the first person.</p>

<p>Ye or you, is the second person.</p>

<p>They, is the third person.</p></div>

<p>This account of persons will be very intelligible when the following
Pastoral Fragment is reflected on:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 6em;"><small>HE.</small></span></p>

<p><i>I</i> love thee, Susan, on my life:<br />
<i>Thou</i> art the maiden for a wife.<br />
<i>He</i> who lives single is an ass;<br />
<i>She</i> who ne’er weds a luckless lass.<br />
<i>It’s</i> tiresome work to live alone;<br />
So come with me, and be my own.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 6em;"><small>SHE.</small></span></p>

<p><i>We</i> maids are oft by men deceived;<br />
<i>Ye</i> don’t deserve to be believed;<br />
<i>You</i> don’t&mdash;but there’s my hand&mdash;heigho!<br />
<i>They</i> tell us, women can’t say no!</p></div>

<p>The speaker or speakers are of the first person; those spoken to, of the
second; and those spoken of, of the third.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>Of the three persons, the first is the most universally admired.</p>

<p>The second is the object of much adulation and flattery, and now and then
of a little abuse.</p>

<p>The third person is generally made small account of; and, amongst other
grievances, suffers a great deal from being frequently bitten about the
back.</p>

<p>The Numbers of pronouns, like those of substantives, are, as we have
already seen, two; the singular and the plural.</p>

<p>In addressing yourself to anybody, it is customary to use the second
person plural instead of the singular. This practice most probably arose
from a notion, that to be thought twice the man that the speaker was,
gratified the vanity of the person addressed. Thus, the French put a
double Monsieur on the backs of their letters.</p>

<p>Editors say “We,” instead of “I,” out of modesty.</p>

<p>The Quakers continue to say “thee” and “thou,” in the use of which
pronouns, as well as in the wearing of broad-brimmed hats and of stand-up
collars, they perceive a peculiar sanctity.</p>

<p>Gender has to do only with the third person singular of the pronouns, he,
she, it. He is masculine; she is feminine; it is neuter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>Pronouns have the like cases with substantives; the nominative, the
possessive, and the objective.</p>

<p>Would that they were the hardest cases to be met with in this country!</p>

<p>The personal pronouns are thus declined:&mdash;</p>

<p>We beg to inform thee, that the third person plural has no distinction of
gender.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SECTION II.</p>
<p class="center">OF THE RELATIVE PRONOUNS.</p>

<p>The Pronouns called Relative are such as relate, for the most part, to
some word or phrase, called the antecedent, on account of its going
before: they are, <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, and <i>that</i>: as, “The man <i>who</i> does not
drink enough when he can get it, is a fool; but he <i>that</i> drinks too much
is a beast.”</p>

<p><i>What</i> is usually equivalent to <i>that which</i>, and is, therefore, a kind of
compound relative, containing both the antecedent and the relative; as,
“You want <i>what</i> you’ll very soon have!” that is to say, <i>the thing which</i>
you will very soon have.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span><i>Who</i> is applied to persons, <i>which</i> to animals and things without life;
as, “He is a <i>gentleman who</i> keeps a horse and lives respectably.” “To the
<i>dog which</i> pinned the old woman, they cried, ‘Cæsar!’” “This is the <i>tree
which</i> Larkins called a <i>h</i>elm.”</p>

<p>Larkins.&mdash;I say, Nibbs, ven is a helm box like a asthmatical chest?</p>

<p>Nibbs.&mdash;Ven it’s a <i>coffin</i>.</p>

<p><i>That</i>, as a relative, is used to prevent the too frequent repetition of
<i>who</i> and <i>which</i>, and is applied both to persons and things; as, “<i>He
that</i> stops the bottle is a <i>Cork</i> man.” “This is the house <i>that</i> Jack
built.”</p>

<p><i>Who</i> is of both numbers; and so is an Editor; for, according to what we
observed just now, he is both singular and plural. <i>Who</i>, we repeat, is of
both numbers, and is thus declined:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">SINGULAR AND PLURAL.</p>

<p><i>Which</i>, <i>that</i>, and <i>what</i> are indeclinable; except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> that <i>whose</i> is
sometimes used as the possessive case of <i>which</i>; as,</p>

<p class="poem">“The roe, poor dear, laments amain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>Whose</i> sweet hart was by hunter slain.”</span></p>

<p>Thus <i>whose</i> is substituted for <i>of which</i>, in the following example:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">“There is a blacking famed, <i>of which</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The sale made Day and Martin rich;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There is another blacking, <i>whose</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Compounder patronised the Muse.”<small><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1" href="#f2">[2]</a></small></span></p>

<p><i>Who</i>, <i>which</i>, and <i>what</i>, when they are used in asking questions, are
called Interrogatives; as, “<i>Who</i> is Mr. Walker?” “<i>Which</i> is the left
side of a round plum-pudding?” “<i>What</i> is the damage?”</p>

<p>Those who have made popular phraseology their study, will have found that
<i>which</i> is sometimes used for <i>whereas</i>, and words of like signification;
as in Dean Swift’s “Mary the Cookmaid’s Letter to Dr. Sheridan”:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">“And now I know whereby you would fain make an excuse,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Because my master one day in anger call’d you a goose;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>Which</i>, and I am sure I have been his servant since October,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And he never called me worse than sweetheart, drunk or sober.”</span></p>

<p><i>What</i>, or, to speak more <i>im</i>properly, <i>wot</i>, is generally substituted by
cabmen and costermongers for <i>who</i>; as, “The donkey <i>wot</i> wouldn’t go.”
“The man <i>wot</i> sweeps the crossing.”</p>

<p><i>That</i>, likewise, is very frequently rejected by the vulgar, who use <i>as</i>
in its place; as, “Them <i>as</i> asks shan’t have any; and them <i>as</i> don’t ask
don’t want any.”</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SECTION III.</p>
<p class="center">OF THE ADJECTIVE PRONOUNS.</p>

<p>Adjective pronouns partake of the nature of both pronouns and adjectives.
They may be subdivided into four sorts: the possessive, the distributive,
the demonstrative, and the indefinite.</p>

<p>The possessive pronouns are those which imply possession or property. Of
these there are seven; namely, <i>my</i>, <i>thy</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>our</i>, <i>your</i>,
<i>their</i>.</p>

<p>The word <i>self</i> is added to possessives; as, myself, yourself, “Says I to
myself, says I.” <i>Self</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> also sometimes used with personal pronouns;
as, himself, itself, themselves. <i>His</i> self is a common, but not a proper
expression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img18.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center"><small>SELF-ESTEEM.</small></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The distributive are three: <i>each</i>, <i>every</i>, <i>either</i>; they denote the
individual persons or things separately, which, when taken together, make
up a number.</p>

<p><i>Each</i> is used when two or more persons or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> things are mentioned singly;
as, “<i>each</i> of the Catos;” “<i>each</i> of the Browns.”</p>

<p><i>Every</i> relates to one out of several; as, “<i>Every</i> mare is a horse, but
<i>every</i> horse is not a mare.”</p>

<p><i>Either</i> refers to one out of two; as,</p>

<p class="poem">“When I between two jockeys ride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I have a knave on <i>either</i> side.”</span></p>

<p><i>Neither</i> signifies “not either;” as “<i>Neither</i> of the Bacons was related
to Hogg.”</p>

<p>The demonstrative pronouns precisely point out the subjects to which they
relate; such are <i>this</i> and <i>that</i>, with their plurals <i>these</i> and
<i>those</i>; as, “<i>This</i> is a foreign Prince; <i>that</i> is an English Peer.”</p>

<p><i>This</i> refers to the nearest person or thing, and to the latter or last
mentioned; <i>that</i> to the most distant, and to the former or first
mentioned; as, “<i>This</i> is a man; <i>that</i> is a nondescript.” “At the period
of the Reformation in Scotland, a curious contrast between the ancient and
modern ecclesiastical systems was observed; for while <i>that</i> had been
always maintained by a <i>Bull</i>, <i>this</i> was now supported by a <i>Knox</i>.”</p>

<p>The indefinite are those which express their subjects in an indefinite or
general manner; as, <i>some</i>, <i>other</i>, <i>any</i>, <i>one</i>, <i>all</i>, <i>such</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>When the definite article <i>the</i> comes before the word <i>other</i>, those who
do not know better, are accustomed to strike out the <i>he</i> in <i>the</i>, and to
say, <i>t’other</i>.</p>

<p>The same persons also use <i>other</i> in the comparative degree; for
sometimes, instead of saying quite the reverse, or perhaps re<i>w</i>erse, they
avail themselves of the expression, <i>more t’other</i>.</p>

<p>So much for the Pronouns.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<p class="title">OF VERBS.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SECTION I.</p>
<p class="center">OF THE NATURE OF VERBS IN GENERAL.</p>

<p>The nature of Verbs in general, and that in all languages, is, that they
are the most difficult things in the Grammar.</p>

<p>Verbs are divided into Active, Passive, and Neuter; and also into Regular,
Irregular, and Defective. To these divisions we beg to add another; Verbs
Comic.</p>

<p>A Verb Active implies an agent, and an object acted upon; as, to love; “I
love Wilhelmina Stubbs.” Here, I am the agent; that is, the lover; and
Wilhelmina Stubbs is the object acted upon, or the beloved object.</p>

<p>A Verb Passive expresses the suffering, feeling, or undergoing of
something; and therefore implies an object acted upon, and an agent by
which it is acted upon; as, to be loved; “Wilhelmina Stubbs is loved by
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>A Verb Neuter expresses neither action nor passion, but a state of being;
as, I bounce, I lie.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img19.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center">“Fact, Madam!”<br />“Gracious, Major!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of Verbs Regular, Irregular, and Defective, we shall have somewhat to say
hereafter.</p>

<p>Verbs Comic are, for the most part, verbs which cannot be found in the
dictionary, and are used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> express ordinary actions in a jocular manner;
as, to “morris,” to “bolt,” to “mizzle,” which signify to go or to depart;
to “bone,” to “prig,” that is to say, to steal; to “collar,” which means
to seize, an expression probably derived from the mode of prehension, or
rather apprehension characteristic of the New Police, as it is one very
much in the mouths of those who most frequently come in contact with that
body: to “lush,” or drink; to “grub,” or eat; to “sell,” or deceive, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Under the head of Verbs Comic, the Yankee-isms, I “calculate,” I “reckon,”
I “realise,” I “guess,” and the like, may also be properly enumerated.</p>

<p>Auxiliary, or helping Verbs (by the way, we marvel that the Americans do
not call their servants auxiliaries instead of helps,) are those, by the
help of which we are chiefly enabled to conjugate our verbs in English.
They are, do, be, have, shall, will, may, can, with their variations; and
let and must, which have no variation.</p>

<p>Let, however, when it is <i>anything but</i> a <i>helping</i> verb, as, for
instance, when it signifies to <i>hinder</i>, makes lettest and letteth. The
phrase, “This House to Let,” generally used instead of “to be let,” really
meaning the reverse of what it is intended to convey, is a piece of comic
English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>To verbs belong Number, Person, Mood, and Tense. These may be called the
properties of a verb; and like those of opium, they are soporiferous
properties. There are two very important objects which the writer of every
book has, or ought to have in view, to get a reader who is wide awake, and
to keep him so:&mdash;the latter of which, when Number, Person, Mood, and Tense
are to be treated of, is no such easy matter; seeing that the said writer
is then in some danger of going to sleep himself. Never mind. If we nod,
let the reader wink. What can’t be cured must be endured.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SECTION II.</p>
<p class="center">OF NUMBER AND PERSON.</p>

<p>Verbs have two numbers, the Singular and the Plural; as, “I fiddle, we
fiddle,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>In each number there are three persons; as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td>

    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>He loves</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>They love.</td></tr></table>

<p>What a deal there is in every Grammar about love! Here the following
Lines, by a Young Lady (now no more), addressed to Lindley Murray, deserve
to be recorded:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
“Oh, Murray! fatal name to me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Thy burning page with tears is wet;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Since first ‘to love’ I learned of thee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Teach me, ah! teach me ‘to forget!’”</span></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SECTION III.</p>
<p class="center">OF MOODS AND PARTICIPLES.</p>

<p>Mood or Mode is a particular form of the verb, or a certain variation
which it undergoes, showing the manner in which the being, action, or
passion, is represented.</p>

<p>The moods of verbs are five, the Indicative, the Imperative, the
Potential, the Subjunctive, and the Infinitive.</p>

<p>The Indicative Mood simply points out or declares a thing: as, “He
teaches, he is taught;” or it asks a question: as, “Does he teach? Is he
taught?”</p>

<p>Q. Why is old age the best teacher?</p>

<p>A. Because he gives you the most <i>wrinkles</i>.</p>

<p>Q. Why does a rope support a rope-dancer?</p>

<p>A. Because it is <i>taught</i>.</p>

<p>The Imperative Mood commands, exhorts, entreats, or permits: as, “Vanish
thou; trot ye; let us hop; be off!”</p>

<p>The Potential Mood implies possibility or liberty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> power, will, or
obligation: as, “A waiter <i>may be</i> honest. You may stand upon truth or
lie. I can filch. He would cozen. They should learn.”</p>

<p>The Subjunctive Mood is used to represent a thing as done conditionally;
and is preceded by a conjunction, expressed or understood, and accompanied
by another verb: as, “<i>If</i> the skies should fall, larks would be caught.”
“Were I to punch your head, I should serve you right;” that is, “<i>if</i> I
were to punch your head.”</p>

<p>The Infinitive Mood expresses a thing generally, without limitation, and
without any distinction of number or person: as, “to quarrel, to fight, to
be licked.”</p>

<p>The Participle is a peculiar form of the verb, and is so called, because
it participates in the properties both of a verb and of an adjective: as,
“May I have the pleasure of <i>dancing</i> with you?” “<i>Mounted</i> on a tub he
addressed the bystanders.” “<i>Having</i> uplifted a stave, they departed.”</p>

<p>The Participles are three; the Present or Active, the Perfect or Passive,
and the Compound Perfect: as, “I felt nervous at the thought of <i>popping</i>
the question, but that once <i>popped</i>, I was not sorry for <i>having popped</i>
it.”</p>

<p>The worst of <i>popping</i> the question is, that the <i>report</i> is always sure
to get abroad.</p>


<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">SECTION IV.</p>
<p class="center">OF THE TENSES.</p>

<p>Tense is the distinction of time, and consists of six divisions, namely,
the Present, the Imperfect, the Perfect, the Pluperfect, and the First and
Second Future Tenses.</p>

<p>Time is also distinguished by a fore lock, scythe, and hour-glass; but the
youthful reader must bear in mind, that these things are not to be
confounded with tenses.</p>

<p>The Present Tense, as its name implies, represents an action or event
occurring at the present time: as, “I lament; rogues prosper; the mob
rules.”</p>

<p>The Imperfect Tense represents a past action or event, but which, like a
mutton chop, may be either thoroughly done, or not thoroughly done; were
it <i>meet</i>, we should say <i>under-done</i>: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“When I <i>was</i> a little boy some fifteen years ago,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My mammy <i>doted</i> on me&mdash;Lork! she <i>made</i> me quite a show.”</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">“When our reporter left, the Honourable Gentleman <i>was</i> still on his
legs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>The legs of most “Honourable Gentlemen” must be tolerably stout ones; for
the “majority” do not stand on trifles. However, we are not going to
<i>commit</i> ourselves, like <i>some</i> folks, nor to get <i>committed</i>, like
<i>other</i> folks; so we will leave “<i>Honourable</i> Gentlemen” to manage matters
their own way.</p>

<p>The Perfect Tense declares a thing to have been done at some time, though
an indefinite one, antecedent to the present time. That, however, which
the Perfect Tense represents as done, is completely, or, as we say of John
Bull, when he is humbugged by the thimble-rig people, regularly done; as,
“I <i>have been</i> out on the river.” “I <i>have caught</i> a crab.”</p>

<p>Catching a crab is a thing <i>regularly</i> (in another sense than completely)
done, when civic swains pull young ladies up to Richmond. We beg to inform
persons unacquainted with aquatic phraseology, that “pulling up” young
ladies, or others, is a very different thing from “pulling up” an omnibus
conductor or a cabman. What an equivocal language is ours! How much less
agreeable to be “pulled up” at Bow Street than to be “pulled up” in a
wherry! how wide the discrepancy between “pulling up” radishes and
“pulling up” horses!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>The Pluperfect Tense represents a thing as doubly past; that is, as past
previously to some other point of time also past; as, “I fell in love
before I <i>had arrived</i> at years of discretion.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img20.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The First Future Tense represents the action as yet to come, either at a
certain or an uncertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> time; as, “The tailor <i>will send</i> my coat home
to-morrow; and when I find it perfectly convenient, I <i>shall pay</i> him.”</p>

<p>The Second Future intimates that the action will be completed at or before
the time of another future action or event; as, “I wonder how many
conquests I <i>shall have made</i> by to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>N.B. One ball is often the means of killing a great many people.</p>

<p>The consideration of the tenses suggests various moral reflections to the
thinking mind.</p>

<p>A few examples will perhaps suffice:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Present</i>, though moderate fruition, is preferable to splendid, but
contingent <i>futurity</i>; i. e. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.</p>

<p>2. <i>Imperfect</i> nutrition is less to be deprecated than privation of
aliment;&mdash;a new way of putting an old proverb, which we need not again
insert, respecting half a loaf.</p>

<p>3. <i>Perfect</i> callidity was the distinguishing attribute of the Curved
Pedestrian.</p>

<p>Callidity is another word for craftiness; but for the exercise of the
reader’s ingenuity, we forbear to mention the person alluded to as so
remarkable for his astutious qualities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>Q. What species of <i>writing</i> is most conducive to morality?</p>

<p>A. <i>Text</i>-hand.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SECTION V.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">the conjugation of the auxiliary verbs To Have and To Be.</span></p>

<p>We have observed that boys, in conjugating verbs, give no indications of
delight, except that which an ingenuous disposition always feels in the
acquisition of knowledge. Now, having arrived at that part of the Grammar
in which it becomes necessary that these same verbs should be considered,
we feel ourselves in an awkward dilemma. The omission of the conjugations
is a <i>serious</i> omission&mdash;which, of course, is objectionable in a <i>comic</i>
work&mdash;and the insertion of them would be equally serious, and therefore
quite as improper. What <i>shall</i> we do? We will adopt a middle course;
referring the reader to Murray and other talented authors for full
information on these matters; and requesting him to be content with our
confining ourselves to what is more especially suitable to these pages&mdash;a
short summary of the <i>Comicalities</i> of verbs.</p>

<p>The Conjugation of a verb is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> combination and arrangement of its
numbers, persons, moods, and tenses.</p>

<p>The Comicalities of verbs consist in certain liberties taken with their
numbers, persons, moods, and tenses.</p>

<p>The Conjugation of an active verb is called the Active Voice, and that of
a passive Verb the Passive Voice.</p>

<p>If verbs have voices, it is but reasonable that walls should have ears.</p>

<p>The auxiliary and active verb To Have is thus peculiarly conjugated by
some people in some of its moods and tenses.</p>

<p class="center">TO HAVE.</p>
<p class="center">INDICATIVE MOOD.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When this part of Grammar occurs to your brain.</span></p>

<p>As there is a certain <i>intensity</i> of feeling abroad, which renders people
indisposed to trouble themselves with <i>verbal</i> matters, we shall take the
liberty of making very short work of the Regular Verbs. Even Murray can
only afford to conjugate one example,&mdash;To Love. The learner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> must amplify
this part of the Grammar for himself: and we recommend him to substitute
for “to love,” some word less harrowing to a sensitive mind: as, “to
fleece, to tax,” verbs which excite disagreeable emotions only in a sordid
one; and which also, by association of ideas, conduct us to useful
reflections on Political Economy. We advise all whom it may concern,
however, to pay the greatest attention to this part of the Grammar, and
before they come to the Verbs Regular, to make a particular study of the
Auxiliary Verbs: not only for the excellent reasons set forth in “Tristram
Shandy,” but also to avoid those awkward mistakes in which the
Comicalities of the Verbs, or Verbal Comicalities, chiefly consist.</p>

<p>“Did it rain to-morrow?” asked Monsieur Grenouille.</p>

<p>“Yes it was!” replied Monsieur Crapaud.</p>

<p>We propose the following as an <i>auxiliary mode</i> of conjugating verbs:&mdash;“I
love to roam on the crested foam, Thou lovest to roam on the crested foam,
He loves to roam on the crested foam, We love to roam on the crested foam,
Ye or you love to roam on the crested foam, They love to roam on the
crested foam,” &amp;c. These words, if set to music, might serve for a
grammatical <i>glee</i>, and would, at all events, be productive of <i>mirth</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img21.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Auxiliary Verbs, too, are very useful when a peculiar emphasis is
required: as, “I shall give you a drubbing!” “<i>Will</i> you?” “I know a trick
worth two of that.” “<i>Do</i> you, though?” “It <i>might</i>,” as the Quaker said
to the Yankee, who wanted to know what his name might be; “it <i>might</i> be
Beelzebub, but it <i>is</i> not.”</p>

<p>Now we may as well say what we have to say about the conjugation of
regular verbs active.</p>


<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">SECTION VI.</p>
<p class="center">THE CONJUGATION OF REGULAR VERBS ACTIVE.</p>

<p>Regular Verbs Active are known by their forming their imperfect tense of
the indicative mood, and their perfect participle, by adding to the verb
<i>ed</i>, or <i>d</i> only when the verb ends in <i>e</i>: as,</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td align="center"><small>PRESENT.</small></td>
    <td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td>
    <td align="center"><small>IMPERFECT.</small></td>
    <td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td>
    <td><small>PERF. PARTICIP.</small></td></tr>
<tr><td>I reckon.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>I reckoned.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Reckoned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>I realise.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>I realised.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Realised.</td></tr></table>

<p>Here should follow the conjugation of the regular active verb, or, as a
Cockney Romeo would say, the <i>regular</i> torturing verb, To Love; but we
have already assigned a good reason for omitting it; besides which we have
to say, that we think it a verb highly unfit for conjugation by youth, as
it tends to put ideas into their heads which they would otherwise never
have thought of; and it is moreover our opinion, that several of our most
gifted poets may, with reason, have attributed those unfortunate
attachments which, though formed in early youth, served to embitter their
whole lives, to the poison which they thus sucked in with the milk, so to
speak, of their Mother Tongue, the Grammar.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>PASSIVE.</p>

<p>Verbs Passive are said to be regular, when their perfect participle is
formed by the addition of <i>d</i>, or <i>ed</i> to the verb: as, from the verb “To
bless,” is formed the passive, “I am blessed, I was blessed, I shall be
blessed,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>The conjugation of a passive verb is nothing more than the repetition of
that of the auxiliary To Be, the perfect participle being added.</p>

<p>And now, having cut the regular verbs (as Alexander did the Gordian knot)
instead of conjugating them, let us proceed to consider the</p>

<p class="center">IRREGULAR VERBS.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SECTION VII.</p>

<p>Irregular Verbs are those of which the imperfect tense and the perfect
participle are <i>not</i> formed by adding <i>d</i> or <i>ed</i> to the verb: as,</p>

    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>I blew.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>blown.</td></tr></table>

<p>To say I am blown, is, under certain circumstances, such as windy and
tempestuous weather, proper enough; but I am blowed, it will at once be
perceived, is not only an ungrammatical, but also a vulgar expression.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
<p class="title">OF ADVERBS.</p>


<p>Having as great a dislike as the youngest of our readers can have to
repetitions, we shall not say what an adverb is over again. It is,
nevertheless, right to observe, that some adverbs are compared: as, far,
farther, farthest; near, nearer, nearest. In comparing those which end in
<i>ly</i>, we use <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>: as, slowly, more slowly, most slowly.</p>

<p>Q. Who, of all the civic functionaries, moves “most slowly?”</p>

<p>A. Mr. Hobler.</p>

<p>There are a great many adverbs in the English Language: their number is
probably even greater than that of abusive epithets. They are divisible
into certain classes; the chief of which are Number, Order, Place, Time,
Quantity, Manner or Quality, Doubt, Affirmation, Negation, Interrogation,
and Comparison.</p>

<p>A nice little list, truly! and perhaps some of our readers may suppose
that we are going to exemplify it at length: if so, all we can say with
regard to their expectation is, that we wish they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> get it gratified.
In the meantime, we will not turn our Grammar into a dictionary, to please
anybody. However, we have no objection to a brief illustration of the uses
and properties of adverbs, as contained in the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<i>Formerly</i>, <i>when first</i> I began to preach and to teach, <i>whithersoever</i>
I went, the little boys followed me, and <i>now</i> and <i>then</i> pelted me with
brick-bats, as <i>heretofore</i> they pelted Ebenezer Grimes. And <i>whensoever</i>
I opened my mouth, <i>straightways</i> the ungodly began to crow. <i>Oftentimes</i>
was I hit in the mouth with an orange: <i>yea</i>, and <i>once</i>, <i>moreover</i>, with
a rotten egg; <i>whereat</i> there was much laughter, which, <i>notwithstanding</i>,
I took in good part, and wiped my face, and looked <i>pleasantly</i>. For
<i>peradventure</i> I said, they will listen to my sermon; <i>yea</i>, and after
that we may have a collection. So I was <i>nowise</i> discomfited; <i>wherefore</i>
I advise thee, Brother Habakkuk, to take no heed of thy persecutors,
seeing that I, <i>whereas</i> I was once little better off than thyself, have

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<p class="title">OF PREPOSITIONS.</p>


<p>Prepositions are, for the most part, put before nouns and pronouns: as,
“out <i>of</i> the frying-pan <i>into</i> the fire.”</p>

<p>Two prepositions, <i>with</i> and <i>without</i>, are sometimes (as we have been
informed) used in the place of substantives: as, “cold <i>without</i>, warm
<i>with</i>.”</p>

<p>The preposition <i>of</i> is sometimes used as a part of speech of peculiar
signification, and one to which no name has as yet been applied: as, “What
have you been doing <i>of</i>?”</p>

<p><i>At</i> and <i>up</i> are not rarely used as verbs, but we should scarcely have
been justified in so classing them by the authority of any polite writer;
such use of them being confined to the vulgar: as, “Now then, Bill, <i>at</i>
him again.” “So she <i>upped</i> with her fists, and fetched him a whop.”</p>

<p><i>After</i> is improperly pronounced <i>arter</i>, and <i>against</i>, <i>agin</i>: as,
“Hallo! Jim, vot are you <i>arter</i>? don’t you know that ere’s <i>agin</i> the
Law?”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
<p class="title">OF CONJUNCTIONS.</p>


<p>A Conjunction means literally, a union or meeting together. An
ill-assorted marriage is</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img22.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center"><small>A COMICAL CONJUNCTION.</small></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>But our conjunctions are used to connect words and sentences, and have
nothing to do with the joining of hands. They are chiefly of two sorts,
the Copulative and Disjunctive.</p>

<p>The Copulative Conjunction is employed for the connection or continuation
of a sentence: as, “Jack <i>and</i> Gill went up the Hill,” “I will sing a song
<i>if</i> Gubbins will,” “A thirsty man is like a City Giant, <i>because</i> he is a
Gog for drink.”</p>

<p>The Conjunction Disjunctive is used not only for purposes of connection,
but also to express opposition of meaning in different degrees: as,
“<i>Though</i> Lord John is as cunning as a Fox, <i>yet</i> Sir Robert is as deep as
a Pitt.” “We pay less for our letters, <i>but</i> shall have to pay more for
our panes: they have lightened our postage, <i>but</i> they will darken our
rooms.”</p>

<p>Conjunctions are the hooks and eyes of Language, in which, as well as in
dress, it is very possible to make an awkward use of them: as, “For <i>if</i>
the year consist of 365 days 6 hours, <i>and</i> January have 31 days, <i>then</i>
the relation between the corpuscular theory of light <i>and</i> the new views
of Mr. Owen is at once subverted: <i>for</i>, ‘When Ignorance is bliss, ’tis
folly to be wise:’ <i>because</i> 1760 yards make a mile; <i>and</i> it is
universally acknowledged that ‘war is the madness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> of many for the gain of
a few:’ <i>therefore</i> Sir Isaac Newton was quite right in supposing the
diamond to be combustible.”</p>

<p>The word <i>as</i>, so often used in this and other Grammars, is a conjunction:
as, “Mrs. A. is <i>as</i> well <i>as</i> can be expected.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img23.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>The Siamese twins formed a singular conjunction.</p>

<p>A tin pot fastened to a dog’s tail is a disagreeable conjunction to the
unfortunate animal.</p>

<p>A happy pair may be regarded as an uncommon conjunction.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>
<p class="title">INTERJECTIONS.</p>


<p>We have said almost enough about their Etymology already. Still, it may
not be superfluous to bestow a passing notice on the singularly expressive
character of certain of these parts of speech, heard, it is true,
repeatedly; but unaccountably omitted in all previous Grammars. For
instance, how many lives does the warning, “Hoy!” of the coachman or
cab-driver daily save? What an amount of infantile aberrations from
propriety is the admonitory “Paw-paw!” the means of checking. With what
felicity is acquiescence denoted by “Umph!” The utility of the
Interjections on various occasions, such as our meals, for example, in
enabling us to economise our speech, is very striking.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>
<p class="title">OF DERIVATION.</p>


<p>Those who know Latin, Greek, Saxon, and the other languages from which our
own is formed, do not require to be instructed in philological derivation;
and on those who do not understand the said tongues, such instruction
would be thrown away. In what manner English words are derived, one from
another, the generality of persons know very well: there are, however, a
few words and phrases, which it is expedient to trace to their respective
sources; not only because such an exercise is of itself delightful to the
inquiring mind; but because we shall thereby be furnished (as we hope to
show) with a test by means of which, on hearing an expression for the
first time, we shall be able, in most instances, to decide at once
respecting its nature and quality.</p>

<p>There are several words in the English Language which were originally
Terms of Art, but came in process of time to be applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> metaphorically to
the common purposes of discourse. Thus lodgings are sometimes called
<i>quarters</i>; a word which, in its restricted sense, signifies the lodgings
of soldiers; ill habits, like diseases, are said to be <i>remedied</i>; men
hope, as if indicted for an offence, that ladies will <i>acquit</i> them of
inattention, and so forth. When, as in the instances cited, the word or
phrase can be traced back either to one of the Learned Professions, or to
any source savouring of gentility, it is esteemed a proper one, and there
is no objection to its use.</p>

<p>Now we have divers other words, of which many have but recently come into
vogue, which, though by no means improper or immoral, are absolutely
unutterable in any polite assembly. It is not, at first, very easy to see
what can be the objection to their use; but derivation explains it for us
in the most satisfactory manner. The truth is, that the expressions in
question take their origin from various trades and occupations, in which
they have, for the most part, a literal meaning; and we now perceive what
horrible suspicions respecting one’s birth, habits, and education, their
figurative employment would be likely to excite. To make the matter
indisputably clear, we will explain our position by a few examples.</p>

<p>Numerous examples, similar to the foregoing, will, no doubt, present
themselves, in addition, to the mind of the enlightened student. We have
not, however, quite done yet with our remarks on this division of our
subject. The intrinsic vulgarity of all modes of speech which may be
traced to mean or disreputable persons, will, of course, not be
questioned. But&mdash;and as we have got hold of a nice bone, we may as well
get all the marrow we can out of it&mdash;the principle which is now under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
consideration has a much wider range than is apparent at first sight.</p>

<p>Now we will suppose a red-hot lover addressing the goddess of his
idolatry&mdash;by the way, how strange it is, that these goddesses should be
always having their temples on fire, that a Queen of Hearts should ever be
seated on a burning throne!&mdash;but to return to the lover: he was to say
something. Well, then, let A. B. be the lover. He expresses himself
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mary, my earthly hopes are centred in you. You need not doubt me; my
heart is true as the dial to the sun. Words cannot express how much I love
you. Nor is my affection an ordinary feeling: it is a more exalted and a
more enduring sentiment than that which usually bears its name. I have
done. I am not eloquent: I can say no more, than that I deeply and
sincerely love you.”</p>

<p>This, perhaps, will be regarded by connoisseurs as tolerably pathetic, and
for the kind of thing not very ridiculous. Now, let A. S. S. be the lover;
and let us have his version of the same story:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mary, my capital in life is invested in you. You need not stick at giving
me credit; my heart is as safe as the Bank of England. The sum total of my
love for you defies calculation. Nor is my attachment anything in the
common way. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> superior and more durable article than that in
general wear. My stock of words is exhausted. I am no wholesale dealer in
that line. All I can say is, that I have a vast fund of unadulterated
affection for you.”</p>

<p>In this effusion the Stock Exchange, the Multiplication Table, and the
Linendraper’s and Grocer’s shops have been drawn upon for a clothing to
the suitor’s ideas; and by an unhappy choice of words, the most delightful
and amiable feelings of our nature, without which Life would be a Desert
and Man a bear, are invested with a ridiculous disguise.</p>

<p>We would willingly enlarge upon the topic which we have thus slightly
handled, but that we feel that we should by so doing, intrench too far on
the boundaries of Rhetoric, to which science, more particularly than to
Grammar, the consideration of Metaphor belongs; besides which, it is high
time to have done with Etymology. Here, then, gentlemen, if you please, we
shall pull up.</p>

<p>“Pull up! what an expression!”</p>

<p>“Well, Sir, did you never hear that next to the <i>Bar</i> the first school of
grammatical elegance is the <i>Stage</i>?”</p>

<h2>PART III.<br />SYNTAX.</h2>


<p>“Now then, reader, if you are quite ready, we are&mdash;All right! * * * *”</p>

<p>The asterisks are intended to stand for a word used in speaking to horses.
Don’t blush, young ladies; there’s not a shadow of harm in it: but as to
spelling it, we are as unable to do so as the ostler’s boy was, who was
thrashed for his ignorance by his father.</p>

<p>“Where are we now, coachman?”</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SYNTAX.</p>

<p>“The third part of Grammar, Sir, wot treats of the agreement and
construction of words in a sentence.”</p>

<p>“Does a coachman say <i>wot</i> for <i>which</i> because he has a licence?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say, Ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Drive on, coachman.”</p>

<p>And <i>we</i> must <i>drive on</i>, or <i>boil on</i>, or whatever it is the fashion to
call getting on in these times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>A sentence is an aggregate of words forming a complete sense.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, a sentence is an aggregate of words forming complete
nonsense: as,</p>

<p>“They are very civil and attentive to the smallest order, and furnish a
house entirely complete, <i>for twenty-seven guineas, all new and well
seasoned</i>.”&mdash;Advertisement in the Times.</p>

<p>Sentences are of two kinds, simple and compound.</p>

<p>A simple sentence has in it but one subject and one finite verb; that is,
a verb to which number and person belong: as, “A joke is a joke.”</p>

<p>A compound sentence consists of two or more simple sentences connected
together: as, “A joke is a joke, but a ducking is no joke. Corpulence is
the attribute of swine, mayors, and oxen.”</p>

<p>Simple sentences may be divided (if we choose to take the trouble) into
the Explicative or explaining; the Interrogative, or asking; the
Imperative, or commanding.</p>

<p>An explicative sentence is, in other words, a direct assertion: as, “Sir,
you are impertinent.”&mdash;<i>Johnson.</i></p>

<p>An interrogative sentence “merely asks a question:” as, “Are you a
policeman? How’s your Inspector?”</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img24.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center">“How’s your Inspector?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>An imperative sentence is expressive of command, exhortation, or entreaty:
as, “Shoulder arms!” “Turn out your toes!” “Charge bayonets!”</p>

<p>A phrase is two or more words properly put together, making either a
sentence or part of a sentence: as, “Good morning!” “Your most obedient!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>Some phrases consist of two or more words improperly put together: these
are improper phrases: as, “Now then, old stupid!” “Stand out of the
sunshine!”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img25.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center">“What a duck of a man!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other phrases consist of words put together by ladies: as, “A duck of a
man,” “A love of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> a shawl,” “<i>so</i> nice,” “quite refreshing,” “sweetly
pretty.” “Did you ever?” “No I never!”</p>

<p>Other phrases again consist of French and English words put together by
people of quality, because their knowledge of both languages is pretty
nearly equal: as, “I am au désespoir,” “mis hors de combat,” “quite
ennuyé,” or rather in nine cases out of ten, “ennuy<i>ée</i>,”&mdash;“I have a great
envie” to do so and so. These constitute an important variety of comic
English.</p>

<p>Besides the above, there are various phrases which we may call elliptical
phrases, consisting principally of the peculiar terms employed in the
different trades and professions: as,</p>

<p>“A Milton Lost,” by booksellers.</p>

<p>“A Lady (of the Lake) in sheets,” do.</p>

<p>“One college (pudding) for No. 6,” by waiters.</p>

<p>“To carry off:” as, “See how the old woman in a red cloak carries off the
tower,” by painters, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The principal parts of a simple sentence are, the subject, the attribute,
and the object.</p>

<p>If you want to know what <i>subjects</i> and <i>objects</i> are, you should go to
the Morgue at Paris. But in Grammar&mdash;</p>

<p>The subject is the thing chiefly spoken of; the attribute is that which is
affirmed or denied of it; and the object is the thing affected by such
action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>The nominative denotes the subject, and usually goes before the verb or
attribute; and the word or phrase, denoting the object, follows the verb;
as, “The flirt torments her lover.” Here, <i>a flirt</i> is the subject;
<i>torments</i>, the attribute or thing affirmed; and <i>her lover</i>, the object.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img26.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>Yes, and a pretty <i>object</i> he is too, sometimes. But then we shall be told
that he is <i>not</i> an object&mdash;of attachment. Alas! that is the very reason
why he <i>is</i> an object&mdash;of compassion, or ridicule, according to people’s
dispositions.</p>

<p>It may be also said that the flirt herself is a <i>pretty</i> object. All we
can say is, that we never saw such a flirt, nor do we believe that we ever
shall.</p>

<p>To torment, it seems, is the <i>attribute</i> of the flirt, as it is that of
the &mdash;&mdash;. Well! no matter. Much good may the fellowship do her: that is
all!</p>

<p>It strikes us, though, that we are somewhat digressing from our subject,
namely Syntax, which,</p>

<p>Principally consists of two parts (which the flirt does not, for she is
all body and no soul) Concord and Government.</p>

<p>Concord is the agreement which one word has with another, in gender,
number, case or person.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;That a want of agreement between words does not invalidate
<i>deeds</i>. We apprehend that such an engagement as the following, properly
authenticated, would hold good in law.</p>

<p>To produce the agreement and right disposition of words in a sentence, the
following rules (and observations?) should be carefully studied.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE I.</p>

<p>A verb must agree with its nominative case in number and person: as, “I
perceive.” “Thou hast been to Brixton.” “Apes chatter.” “Frenchmen
gabble.”</p>

<p>Certain liberties are sometimes taken with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> rule: as, “I own I likes
good beer.” “You’m a fine fellow, aint yer?” “He’ve been to the Squire’s.”
Such modes of speaking are adopted by those who neither know nor care
anything about grammatical correctness: but there are other persons who
<i>care</i> a great deal about it, but unfortunately do not <i>know</i> what it
consists in. Such folks are very fond of saying, “How it rain!” “It fit
you very well.” “He say he think it very unbecoming,” “I were gone before
you was come,” and so forth, in which forms of speech they perceive a
peculiar elegance.</p>

<p>The infinitive mood, or part of a sentence, is sometimes used as the
nominative case to the verb: as “to be good is to be happy:” which is as
grammatical an assertion as “Toby Good is Toby Happy;” and rather
surpasses it in respect of sense. “That two pippins are a pair, is a
proposition which no man in his senses will deny.”</p>

<p class="poem">“To be a connoisseur in boots,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To hate all rational pursuits,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To make your money fly, as though</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Gold would as fast as mushrooms grow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To haunt the Opera, save whene’er</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There’s anything worth hearing there;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To smirk, to smile, to bow, to dance,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To talk of what they eat in France,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To languish, simper, sue, and sigh,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Are means to gain that worthless part</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A fashionable lady’s heart.”</span></p>

<p>Here are examples enough, in all conscience, of infinitive moods serving
as nominative cases.</p>

<p>All verbs, save only in the infinitive mood or participle, require a
nominative case either expressed or understood: as, “Row with me down the
river,” that is “Row thou, or do thou row.” “Come where the aspens
quiver,” “come thou, or do thou come.” “Fly not yet;” “fly not thou, or do
not thou fly.” “Pass the ruby;” “pass thou, or do thou pass the ruby” (not
the Rubi<i>con</i>). “Drink to me only;” “drink thou, or do thou drink only.”
“Wake, dearest, wake;” “wake thou, or do thou wake.” “Tell her I love
her;” “tell thou, or do thou tell her I love her.” In short, you cannot
listen to a hawker of ballads, crying his commodities about the streets,
without hearing illustrations of the foregoing rule. “Move on!” the well
known mandate of policemen to those who create obstructions, is a very
common exemplification of it. The nominative case is easily <i>understood</i>
in the latter instance; and the person addressed, if he pretend that it is
not, does so at his own peril.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>A well known popular song affords an example of the violation of this
rule.</p>

<p class="poem">“Ven as the Captain comed for to hear on’t,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wery much applauded vot she’d done.”</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img27.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The verb applauded has here no nominative case, whereas it ought to have
been governed by the pronoun <i>he</i>. “He very much applauded,” &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>Every nominative case, except when made absolute, or used, like the Latin
Vocative, in addressing a person, should belong to some verb, implied if
not expressed. A beautiful example of this grammatical maxim, and one,
too, that explains itself, is impressed upon the mind very soon after its
first introduction to <i>letters</i>: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Who kill’d Cock Robin?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>I</i>, said the sparrow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With my bow and arrow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>I kill’d</i> Cock Robin.”</span></p>

<p>Of the neglect of this rule also, the ballad lately mentioned presents an
instance: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“<i>Four-and-twenty brisk young fellows</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Clad in jackets, blue array,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And they took poor Billy Taylor</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">From his true love all avay.”</span></p>

<p>The only verb in these four lines is the verb <i>took</i>, which is governed by
the pronoun <i>they</i>. The four-and-twenty brisk young fellows, therefore,
though undeniably in the nominative, have no verb to belong to: while, at
the same time, whatever may be thought of their behaviour to Mr. William
Taylor, they are certainly not <i>absolute</i> in point of case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>When a verb comes between two nouns, either of which may be taken as the
subject of the affirmation, it may agree with either of them: as,
“Two-and-sixpence <i>is</i> half-a-crown.” Due regard, however, should be paid
to that noun which is most naturally the subject of the verb: it would be
clearly wrong to say, “Ducks and green peas <i>is</i> a delicacy.” “Fleas <i>is</i>
a nuisance.”</p>

<p>A nominative case, standing without a personal tense of a verb, and being
put before a participle, independently of the rest of the sentence, is
called a case absolute: as, “My brethren, <i>to-morrow being</i> Sunday, I
shall preach a sermon in Smithfield; after which we shall join in a hymn,
<i>and that having been sung</i>, Brother Biggs will address you.”</p>

<p>The objective case is sometimes incorrectly made absolute by showmen and
others: as, “Here, gentlemen and ladies, you will see that great warrior
Napoleon Bonaparte, standing agin a tree with his hands in his pockets,
<i>him</i> taking good care to keep out of harm’s vay. And there, on the
extreme right, you will observe the Duky Vellinton a valking about amidst
the red-hot cannon balls, <i>him</i> not caring von straw.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img28.jpg" alt="" /></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE II.</p>

<p>Two or more singular nouns, joined together by a copulative conjunction,
expressed or understood, are equivalent to a plural noun, and therefore
require verbs, nouns, and pronouns, agreeing with them in the plural
number: as, “Veal, wine, and vinegar” (take care how you pronounce these
words) “are very good victuals I vow.” “Burke and Hare were nice men.” “A
hat without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> crown, a tattered coat, threadbare and out at elbows, a
pair of breeches which looked like a piece of dirty patchwork diversified
by various holes, and of boots which a Jew would hardly have raked from a
kennel, at once proclaimed him a man who had seen better days.”</p>

<p>This rule is not always adhered to in discourse quite so closely as a
fastidious ear would require it to be: as, “And so, you know, Mary, and I,
and Jane <i>was</i> a dusting the chairs, and in comes Missus.”</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE III.</p>

<p>When the conjunction disjunctive comes between two nouns, the verb, noun,
or pronoun, is of the singular number, because it refers to each of such
nouns taken separately: as, “A cold in the head, or a sore eye <i>is</i> a
great disadvantage to a lover.”</p>

<p>If singular pronouns, or a noun and pronoun of different persons, be
disjunctively connected, the verb must agree with the person which stands
nearest to it: as “I or thou <i>art</i>.” “Thou or I <i>am</i>.” “I, thou, or he
<i>is</i>,” &amp;c. But as this way of writing or speaking is very inelegant, and
as saying, “Either I am, or thou art,” and so on, will always render
having recourse to it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> unnecessary, the rule just laid down is almost
useless, except inasmuch as it suggests a moral maxim, namely, “Always be
on good terms with your next door neighbour.”</p>

<p>It also forcibly reminds us of some beautiful lines by Moore, in which the
heart, like a tendril, is said to twine round the “nearest and loveliest
thing.” Now the person which is placed nearest the verb is the object of
choice; <i>ergo</i>, the most agreeable person&mdash;<i>ergo</i>, the loveliest person or
thing.</p>

<p>Should a conjunction disjunctive occur between a singular noun or pronoun,
and a plural one, the verb agrees with the plural noun or pronoun: as,
“Neither a king nor his courtiers are averse to butter:” (particularly
when thickly spread). “Darius or the Persians were hostile to Greece.”</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE IV.</p>

<p>A noun of multitude, that is, one which signifies many, can have a verb or
pronoun to agree with it either in the singular or plural number;
according to the import of such noun, as conveying unity or plurality of
idea: as, “The Parliament <i>is</i>&mdash;” we do not choose to say what. “The
nation <i>is</i> humbugged.” “The ministry <i>are</i> exceedingly well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> pensioned.”
“The multitude <i>have</i> to pay many taxes.” “The Council <i>are</i> at a loss to
know what to do.” “The people <i>is</i> a many-headed monster.”</p>

<p>We do not mean to call the people names. We only quote what all parties
say of it when out of office. When they are <i>in</i>, it is&mdash;why, we may
exhaust the alphabet about it, as Sterne tried to do about Love; but he
couldn’t get farther than R.; and therefore, if we break down, it is no
matter. So we will e’en try a leap; and as the maxim “audi alteram partem”
is a favourite one with all rightly constituted minds, our own inclusive,
we will see what can be said on both sides. The people, then, is termed,</p>

<p>And now for a little more Syntax.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE V.</p>

<p>Pronouns agree with their antecedents, and with the nouns to which they
belong, in gender and number: as, “This is the blow <i>which</i> killed Ned.”
“England was once governed by a celebrated King, <i>who</i> was called Rufus
the Red, but <i>whose</i> name was by no means so illustrious as that of
Alfred.” “His Grace and the Baronet had put on <i>their</i> boots.” “The
Countess appeared, and <i>she</i> smiled, but the smile belied <i>her</i>
feelings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>The relative being of the same person with the antecedent, the verb always
agrees with it: as, “Thou <i>who learnest Syntax</i>.” “I <i>who enlighten</i> thy
mind.”</p>

<p>The relative <i>what</i> (incorrectly pronounced) is sometimes used in a manner
which is very exceptionable: as, “The gentleman <i>wot keeps</i> the
wine-vaults.” “None but lovers can feel for <i>them wot loves</i>.” We mention
this error once more, in order to insure its abandonment.</p>

<p>The objective case of the personal pronouns is by some, for want of better
information, employed in the place of <i>these</i> and <i>those</i>: as, “Let <i>them</i>
things alone.” “Now then, Jemes, make haste with <i>them</i> chops.” “Give
<i>them</i> tables a wipe.” “Oh! Julier, turn <i>them</i> heyes away.” “What’s the
use o’ mancipatin’ <i>them</i> niggers?” “Don’t you wish you was one of <i>them</i>
lobsters?” “I think <i>them</i> shawls <i>so</i> pretty!” “Look at <i>them</i> sleeves.”
The adverb <i>there</i>, is sometimes, with additional impropriety, joined to
the pronoun <i>them</i>: as, “Look after <i>them there</i> sheep.”</p>

<p>The objective case of a pronoun in the first person is put after the
interjections <i>Oh!</i> and <i>Ah!</i> as, “Oh! dear me,” &amp;c. The second person,
however, requires a nominative case: as, “Oh! you good-for-nothing man!”
“Ah! thou gay Lothario!”</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img29.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center">“Oh! you good-for-nothing man!”</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE VI.</p>

<p>When there is no nominative case between the relative and the verb, the
relative itself is the nominative to the verb: as, “The master <i>who</i>
flogged us.” “The rods <i>which</i> were used.”</p>

<p>But when the nominative comes between the relative and the verb, the
relative exchanges, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> were, the character of sire for that of son,
and becomes the governed instead of the <i>governor</i>; depending for its case
on some word in its own member of the sentence: as, “He <i>who</i> is now at
the head of affairs, <i>whom</i> the Queen delighteth to honour, <i>whose</i>
Pavilion (if the Court had been there) might have been at Brighton, and to
<i>whom</i> is intrusted the helm of state&mdash;is a Lamb.”</p>

<p>Well, it is to be hoped that he will get on in his boat a little better
than a bear; though why that animal is considered so peculiarly <i>at sea</i>
when on the water, we cannot tell. Man is the only sailor except the
nautilus that we know of. Even the steer is no <i>steersman</i>. The bear,
however, is an ill-conditioned, awkward creature, and very likely to upset
the boat; while the more gentle <i>lamb</i>, whatever may be the perils of his
situation, leaves the rudder alone, remains quietly in his place, and goes
with the stream.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE VII.</p>

<p>The relative and the verb, when the former is preceded by two nominatives
of different persons, may agree in person with either, according to the
sense: as, “I am the young gentleman <i>who do</i> the lovers at the Wells;”
or, “<i>who does</i>.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img30.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let this maxim be borne constantly in mind. “A <i>murderer</i> of good
characters should always be made an <i>example of</i>.”</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE VIII.</p>

<p>Every adjective, and every adjective pronoun, relates to a substantive,
expressed or implied: as,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> “Dando was an unprincipled, as well as a
voracious man.” “Few quarrel with their bread and butter;” that is, “few
<i>persons</i>.” “This is the wonderful eagle of the sun.” That is, “This
<i>eagle</i>,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Adjective pronouns agree in number with their substantives: “This muff,
these muffs; that booby, these boobies; another numscull, other
numsculls.”</p>

<p>Some people say “<i>Those</i> kind of things,” or, “<i>This</i> four-and-twenty
year,” neither of which expressions they have any business to use.</p>

<p>A good deal of speculation has been expended on the word <i>means</i> in
connection with an adjective pronoun. Some will have it that we should
say, “By this mean;” “By that mean;” “By these means;” “By those means:”
others, that we should say, “By <i>this means</i>,” and so on. The practical
rule to be observed is, to treat the substantive, means, as a singular
noun when it refers to what is singular, and when it relates to that which
is plural, as a plural one. The word <i>mean</i> is seldom used in the same
sense with means. We have been induced to advert to this question, by the
desire of giving the reader a caution respecting the use of this same
word, <i>means</i>. It is not uncommon to hear it said in the streets and
elsewhere, “Well, and then, you know, Jem was took afore the beak, <i>by
means of</i> which he had three months.” “Sall was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> intosticated, by
<i>means</i> of which (or vich) she wor fined five bob,” &amp;c. We will not shock
the refined grammarian by the multiplication of examples of this kind;
suffice it to say, that the phrase “by means of which” is substituted for
“in consequence of which,” or, “on which account,” by the lower or
illiterate classes.</p>

<p>Adjectives are sometimes improperly used as adverbs: as, “He behaved very
<i>bad</i>.” “He insulted me most <i>gross</i>.” “He eat and drank <i>uncommon</i>.” “He
wur beat very <i>severe</i>.” “It hailed <i>tremendous</i>,” or, more commonly,
“<i>tremenjus</i>.”</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE IX.</p>

<p>The article <i>a</i> or <i>an</i> agrees with nouns in the singular number only: as,
“A fool, an ass, a simpleton, a ninny, a lout&mdash;I would not give a farthing
for a thousand such.”</p>

<p>The definite article <i>the</i> may agree with nouns in the singular and plural
number: as, “The toast, the ladies, the ducks.”</p>

<p>The articles are often properly omitted; when used, they serve to
determine or limit the thing spoken of: as, “Variety is charming.”
“Familiarity doth breed contempt.” “<i>A</i> stitch in time saves nine.” “<i>The</i>
heart that has truly loved never forgets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>The article <i>a</i> or <i>an</i> is sometimes (we grieve to say it) applied to
nouns in the plural number: as, “A wine-vaults.” “An oyster-rooms.” But
this misapplication of the article is positively shocking.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE X.</p>

<p>One substantive, in the possessive or genitive case, is governed by
another, of a different meaning: as, “A fiddle-stick’s end.” “Monkey’s
allowance.” “Virtue’s reward.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img31.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>Pronouns, as well as nouns, are thus governed by substantives: as, “The
woes of a kitten (like those of a Poet) are expressed by <i>its</i> mews.”</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE XI.</p>

<p>Active verbs govern the objective case: as, “I kissed <i>her</i>.” “She
scratched <i>me</i>.” “Virtue rewards <i>her followers</i>.”</p>

<p>For which reason she is like a cook.</p>

<p>Verbs neuter do not govern an objective case. Observe, therefore, that
such phrases: as, “She <i>cried a good one</i>,” “He <i>came the old soldier</i>
over me,” and so forth, are highly improper in a grammatical point of
view, to say nothing of other objections to them.</p>

<p>These verbs, however, are capable of governing words of a meaning similar
to their own: as, in the affecting ballad of Giles Scroggins&mdash;</p>

<p>“I wont, she cried, and <i>screamed a scream</i>.”</p>

<p>The verb To Be has the same case after it as that which goes before it:
as, “<i>It</i> was <i>I</i>,” not “<i>It</i> was <i>me</i>.” “The <i>Grubbs</i> were <i>they</i> who eat
so much trifle at our last party;” not “The <i>Grubbses</i> were <i>them</i>.”</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE XII.</p>

<p>One verb governs another that depends upon it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> in the infinitive mood:
as, “Cease <i>to smoke</i> pipes.” “Begin <i>to wear</i> collars.” “I advise you <i>to
shave</i>.” “I recommend you <i>to go</i> to church.” “I resolved <i>to visit</i> the
United States.</p>

<p class="poem">“And there I learned <i>to wheel</i> about<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And jump Jim Crow.”</span></p>

<p>In general, the preposition <i>to</i> is used before the latter of two verbs;
but sometimes it is more properly omitted: as, “I saw you <i>take</i> it, young
fellow; come along with me.” “Let me <i>get</i> hold of you, that’s all!” “Did
I hear you <i>speak</i>?” “I’ll let you <i>know</i>!” “You dare not <i>hit</i> me.” “Bid
me <i>discourse</i>.” “You need not <i>sing</i>.”</p>

<p>The preposition <i>for</i> is sometimes unnecessarily intruded into a sentence,
in addition to the preposition <i>to</i>, before an infinitive mood: as, “How
came you <i>for</i> to think, <i>for</i> to go, <i>for</i> to do such a thing?” “Do you
want me <i>for</i> to punch your head?”</p>

<p>Adjectives, substantives, and participles, often govern the infinitive
mood: as, “Miss Hopkins, I shall be happy to dance the next set with you.”
“Oh! Sir, it is impossible to refuse you.” “Have you an inclination to
waltz?” “I shall be delighted in endeavouring to do so.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img32.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The infinitive mood is frequently made absolute, that is, independent of
the rest of the sentence: as, “To say the truth, I was rather the worse
for liquor.” “Not to mince matters, Miss, I love you.” “To begin at the
right end.” “To cut a long tale short,” &amp;c.</p>


<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">RULE XIII.</p>

<p>The relation which words and phrases bear to each other in point of time,
should always be duly marked: instead of saying, “Last night I intended to
have made strong love to her,” we should say, “Last night I intended to
make strong love to her;” because, although the intention of making strong
love may have been abandoned (on reflection) this morning, and is now,
therefore, a thing which is <i>past</i>, yet it is undoubtedly, when last night
and the thoughts connected with it are brought back, again present to the
mind.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE XIV.</p>

<p>Participles have the same power of government with that of the verbs from
which they are derived: as, “Oh, what an exquisite singer Rubini is! I am
so fond of <i>hearing him</i>.” “Look at that horrid man; I declare he is
<i>quizzing us</i>!” “No, he is only <i>taking snuff</i>.” “See, how that thing
opposite keeps <i>making eyes</i>.” “Yes, she is <i>ogling Lumley</i>; I should so
like to pinch her!” “How fond they all are of <i>wearing mustaches</i>! Don’t
you like it?” “Oh, yes! there is no <i>resisting them</i>.” “Heigho! I am
<i>dying to have</i> an ice&mdash;”</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>&mdash;&mdash;Young man for a husband, Miss?<br />
For shame, Sir! don’t be rude!</p>

<p>Participles are sometimes used as substantives: as, “The French mouth is
adapted to <i>the making of</i> grimaces.” “The cobbler is like the parson; he
lives by <i>the mending of</i> soles.” “The tailor reaps a good harvest from
<i>the sewing of</i> cloth.” “Did you ever see <i>a shooting of</i> the moon?”</p>

<p>Is this what the witches mean when they sing, in the acting play of
Macbeth,</p>

<p class="poem">“We <i>fly</i> by night?”</p>

<p>If <i>they</i> “shoot the moon,” they are shooting <i>stars</i>.</p>

<p>There is a mode of using the indefinite article <i>a</i> before a participle,
for which there is no occasion, as it does not convert the participle into
a substantive, and makes no alteration in the sense of what is said; in
this case the <i>article</i>, therefore, is like a wart, a wen, or a knob at
the end of the nose, neither useful nor ornamental: as, “Going out <i>a</i>
shooting.” “Are you a coming to-morrow?” “I was <i>a</i> thinking about what
Jem said.” “Here you are, <i>a</i> going of it, as usual!”</p>

<p>A liberty not unfrequently taken with the English Language, is the
substitution of the perfect participle for the imperfect tense, and of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> imperfect tense for the perfect participle: as, “He <i>run</i> like mad,
with the great dog after him.” “Maria <i>come</i> and told us all about it.”
“When I had <i>wrote</i> the Valentine, I sealed it with my thimble.” “He has
<i>rose</i> to (be) a common-councilman.” “I was <i>chose</i> Lord Mayor.” “I’ve
<i>eat</i> (or <i>a eat</i>) lots of venison in my time.” “I should have <i>spoke</i> if
you hadn’t put in your oar.” “You were <i>mistook</i>.” “He sent her an
affecting copy of verses, which was <i>wrote</i> with a Perryian pen.”</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE XV.</p>

<p>Adverbs are generally placed in a sentence before adjectives, after verbs
active or neuter, and frequently between the auxiliary and the verb: as,
“He came, Sir, and he <i>was most exceedingly drunk</i>; he <i>could hardly
stand</i> upon his legs; he made a <i>very lame</i> discourse; he <i>spoke
incoherently</i> and <i>ridiculously</i>; and <i>was impatiently heard</i> by the whole
assembly.” “He <i>is fashionably</i> dressed.” “She <i>is conspicuously ugly</i>.”
“The eye of jealousy <i>is proverbially sharp</i>, and yet it <i>is indisputably
green</i>.” “Britons <i>may often be sold</i>, but they <i>will never be</i> slaves.”
“The French Marquis was a <i>very charming</i> man; he <i>danced exquisitely</i> and
<i>nimbly</i>, and was <i>greatly admired</i> by all the ladies.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img33.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several adverbs have been coined in America of late; and some of them are
very remarkable for a “particular” elegance: as, “I reckon you’re
<i>catawampously</i> chawed up.”</p>

<p>In the example just given there is to be found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> besides the new adverb, a
word which, if not also new to the English student, is rendered so both by
its orthography and pronunciation; namely, <i>chawed</i>. This term is no other
than “chewed,” modified (as words, like living things, would seem to be),
by transportation to a foreign country. “Chawed up” is a very strong
expression, and is employed to signify the most complete state of
discomfiture and defeat, when a man is as much crushed, mashed, and
comminuted, morally speaking, as if he had literally and corporeally
undergone the process of mastication. “Catawampously” is a concentration
of “hopelessly,” “tremendously,” “thoroughly,” and “irrevocably;” so that
“catawampously chawed up,” means, brought as nearly to a state of utter
annihilation as anything consistently with the laws of nature can possibly
be. For the metaphorical use of the word “chawed,” made by the Americans,
three several reasons have been given: 1. Familiarity with the manner in
which the alligator disposes of his victims. 2. The cannibalism of the
Aborigines. 3. The delicate practice of chewing tobacco. Each of these is
supported by numerous arguments, on the consideration of which it would be
quite out of the question to enter in this place.</p>


<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">RULE XVI.</p>

<p>Two English negatives (like French lovers) destroy one another,&mdash;and
become equivalent to an affirmative: as, “The question before the House
was <i>not</i> an <i>unimportant</i> one;” that is, “it was an important one.” “His
Lordship was free to confess that he did <i>not</i> undertake to say that he
would <i>not</i> on some future occasion give a satisfactory answer to the
right honourable gentleman.”</p>

<p>Thus, at one and the same time, we teach our readers Syntax and
secretiveness.</p>

<p>It is probable that small boys are often unacquainted with this rule; for
many of them, while undergoing personal chastisement, exclaim, for the
purpose, as it would appear, of causing its duration to be shortened&mdash;“Oh
pray, Sir, oh pray, Sir, oh pray, Sir! I <i>won’t</i> do so <i>no</i> more!”</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE XVII.</p>

<p>Prepositions govern the objective case: as, “What did the butcher say <i>of
her</i>?” “He said that she would never do <i>for him</i>; that she was too thin
<i>for a wife</i>, and he was not fond <i>of a spare rib</i>.”</p>

<p>The delicate ear is much offended by any deviation from this rule: as, in
a shocking and vulgar song which it was once our misfortune to hear:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>“There I found the faithless she<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Frying sausages <i>for he</i>.”</span></p>

<p>As also in the conversation of rustics: as, “It’s all one <i>to we</i>.” “Come
out <i>of they ’taters</i>!” “He went to the Parson’s <i>with I</i>.” “<i>From he to
they</i> an’t more nor dree mile.”</p>

<p>We had occasion, in the Etymology, to remark on a certain misuse of the
preposition, <i>of</i>. This, perhaps, is best explained by stating that <i>of</i>,
in the instances cited, is made to usurp the government of cases which are
already under a rightful jurisdiction: as, “<i>What</i> are you got a eating
<i>of</i>?” “He had been a beating <i>of his wife</i>.”</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE XVIII.</p>

<p>Conjunctions connect similar moods and tenses of verbs, and cases of nouns
and pronouns: as, “A coat of arms suspended on a wall is like an executed
traitor; it <i>is hanged, drawn, and quartered</i>.” “If you continue thus <i>to
drink</i> brandy and water <i>and to smoke</i> cigars, you will be like Boreas the
North wind, who <i>takes</i> ‘cold without’ wherever he goes, <i>and</i> always
‘<i>blows</i> a cloud’ when it comes in his way.” “Do you think there is any
thing between <i>him and her</i>?” “Yes; <i>he and she</i> are engaged ones.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img34.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;To ask whether there is any thing between two persons of opposite
sexes, is one way of inquiring whether they are in love with each other.
It is not, however, in our opinion, a very happy phrase, inasmuch as
whatever intervenes between a couple of fond hearts, must tend to prevent
them from coming together. Pyramus and Thisbe, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> Ovid informs us, had
more between them than they liked&mdash;a conjunction disjunctive in the shape
of a wall. And by the bye, now that we are speaking of Pyramus and Thisbe,
we may as well expend a word or two on a matter which, though of much
interest, has never yet been noticed by the learned. Pyramus and Thisbe,
it is well known, used to kiss each other through a hole in the wall which
separated them. Now we have always been puzzled to imagine how they
managed it. We are told by the Poet that they lived&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 13em;">“Ubi dicitur altam</span><br />
Coctilibus muris cinxisse Semiramis urbem”&mdash;</p>

<p>that is to say, where Semiramis is said to have surrounded a lofty
city&mdash;not with <i>cock-tail mice</i>, as Mr. Canning facetiously translated
“Coctilibus muris,”&mdash;but with <i>brick walls</i>. The wall which separated two
adjoining houses must have been at least a brick thick; and although it be
possible, “with Love’s light wings” to “o’erperch” an exceedingly high
wall, it occurs to us that it would be no easy thing for Love’s long lips,
let them be as long as you will, to reach through a moderately thick one.
We do not know exactly what was the breadth of an Assyrian brick, but
supposing it to have been three inches, an inch and a half of lip would
have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> been required on the part of either lover for a kiss which could
barely be sworn by;&mdash;a sort of presentation salute;&mdash;but for one worth
giving or taking, we must allow an additional half inch of mouth to the
gentleman. After all, their noses must have been so much in the way, that
to make the operation at all feasible, either these features must have
been particularly flat, or the aperture a very large one; whereas it is
well known to have been merely a chink. Common observation on the part of
their respective parents would have detected such a gap, and common
prudence would have stopped it up. How, then, are we to reconcile Ovid’s
story with truth? Now, remember, reader, what has been said about noses
and lips. Our deliberate opinion is that Pyramus and Thisbe were <i>a couple
of negroes</i>. We shall be told that it is one utterly irreconcileable with
the description of them given in the Metamorphoses. No matter&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">“The lunatic, the lover, and the poet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Are of imagination all compact.”</span></p>

<p>And considering that the lover&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">“Sees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt,”</p>

<p>we do not see why Abyssinian charms should not be transformed by a poet
into those of Assyria. And so, having proved (to our own satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> at
least) that the beautiful Thisbe was a Hottentot Venus, we will resume the
consideration of conjunctions.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE XIX.</p>

<p>Some conjunctions govern the indicative; some the subjunctive mood. In
general, it is right to use the subjunctive, when contingency or doubt is
implied: as, “<i>If I were</i> to say that the moon is made of green cheese.”
“<i>If I were</i> a wiseacre.” “<i>If I were</i> a Wiltshire-man.” “A lady, <i>unless
she be toasted</i>, is never drunk.”</p>

<p>And when she is toasted, those who are drunk are generally the gentlemen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img35.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center">“The Ladies!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>Those conjunctions which have a positive and absolute signification,
require the indicative mood: as, “He who fasts may be compared to a horse:
for <i>as</i> the animal <i>eats</i> not a bit, <i>so neither does</i> the man partake of
a morsel.” “The rustic is deluded by false hopes, <i>for</i> his daily food
<i>is</i> gammon.”</p>

<p>Every philosopher has his weak points, and in the Sylva Sylvarum may be
found some <i>gammon of Bacon</i>.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE XX.</p>

<p>When a comparison is made between two or more things, the latter noun or
pronoun is not governed by the conjunction <i>than</i> or <i>as</i>, but agrees with
the verb, or is governed by the verb or preposition, expressed or
understood: as, “The French are a lighter people than we,” (that is “than
we are,”) “and yet we are not so dark as they,” that is, “as they are.” “I
should think that they admire me more than them,” that is, “than they
admire them.” “It is a shame, Martha! you were thinking more of that young
officer than me,” that is, “of me.”</p>

<p>Sufficient attention is not always paid, in discourse, to this rule. Thus,
a schoolboy may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> often heard to exclaim, “What did you hit me for, you
great fool? you’re bigger <i>than me</i>. Hit some one of your own size!” “Not
fling farther <i>than him</i>? just can’t I, that’s all!” “You and I have got
more marbles <i>than them</i>.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img36.jpg" alt="" /></p>


<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">RULE XXI.</p>

<p>An ellipsis, or omission of certain words, is frequently allowed, for the
sake of avoiding disagreeable repetitions, and of expressing our ideas in
few words. Instead of saying “She was a little woman, she was a round
woman, and she was an old woman,” we say, making use of the figure
Ellipsis, “She was a little, round, and old woman.”</p>

<p>When, however, the omission of words is productive of obscurity, weakens
the sentence, or involves a violation of some grammatical principle, the
ellipsis must not be used. It is improper to say “Puddings fill who fill
them;” we should supply the word <i>those</i>. “A beautiful leg of mutton and
turnips” is not good language: those who would deserve what they are
talking about ought to say, “A beautiful leg of mutton and fine turnips.”</p>

<p>In common discourse, in which the meaning can be eked out by gestures,
signs, and inarticulate sounds variously modified, the ellipsis is much
more liberally and more extensively employed than in written composition.
“May I have the pleasure of&mdash;hum? ha?” may constitute an invitation to
take wine. “I shall be quite&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;” may serve as an answer in the
affirmative. “So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> then, you see he was&mdash;eh!&mdash;you see&mdash;&mdash;,” is perhaps an
intimation that a man has been hanged. “Well, of all the&mdash;I never!” is
often tantamount to three times as many words expressive of surprise,
approbation, or disapprobation, according to the tone in which it is
uttered. “Will you?&mdash;ah!&mdash;will you?&mdash;ah!&mdash;ah!&mdash;ah!” will do either for
“Will you be so impertinent, you scoundrel? will you dare to do so another
time?” or, “Will you, dearest, loveliest, most adorable of your sex, will
you consent to make me happy; will you be mine? speak! answer, I entreat
you! One word from those sweet lips will make me the most fortunate man in
existence!”</p>

<p>There is, however, a kind of ellipsis which those who indulge in that
style of epistolary writing, wherein sentiments of a tender nature are
conveyed, will do well to avoid with the greatest care. The ellipsis
alluded to, is that of the first person singular of the personal pronoun,
as instanced in the following model of a billet-doux:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span style="padding-right: 2em;">Camberwell,</span><br />
April 1, 1840.</p>

<p><small>MY DEAREST FANNY,</small></p>

<p>Have not enjoyed the balm of sleep all the livelong night.
Encountered, last night, at the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>ball, the beau ideal of my heart.
Never knew what love was till then. Derided the sentiment often;
jested at scars, because had never felt a wound. Feel at last the
power of beauty&mdash;Write with a tremulous hand; waver between hope and
fear. Hope to be thought not altogether unworthy of regard: fear to be
rejected as having no pretensions to the affections of such
unparalleled loveliness. Know not in what terms to declare my
feelings. Adore you, worship you, dote on you, am wrapt up in you!
think but on you, live but for you, would willingly die for you!&mdash;in
short, love you! and imploring you to have some compassion on one who
is distracted for your sake</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Remain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Devotedly yours</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><span class="smcap">T. Tout</span>.</span></p></div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">RULE XXII.</p>

<p>A regular and dependent construction should be carefully preserved
throughout the whole of a sentence, and all its parts should correspond to
each other. There is, therefore, an inaccuracy in the following sentence;
“Greenacre was more admired, but not so much lamented, as Burke.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> It
should be, “Greenacre was more admired than Burke, but not so much
lamented.”</p>

<p>Of these two worthies there will be a notice of the following kind in a
biographical dictionary, to be published a thousand years hence in
America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Greenacre.</span>&mdash;A celebrated critic who so cut up a blue-stocking lady of the
name of Brown, that he did not leave her a leg to stand upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Burke.</span>&mdash;A famous orator, whose power of stopping people’s mouths was said
to be prodigious. It is farther reported of him that he was only once hung
up, and that on the occasion of the last speech he ever made.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be said that the rule last stated comprehends all preceding
rules, and requires exemplification accordingly. We therefore call the
attention of the reader to the following paragraph, requesting him to
consider what, and how many, violations of the maxims of Syntax it
contains.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“We teaches, that is, my son and me teaches, they boys English
Grammar. Tom or Dick have learned something every day but Harry what
is idler, whom I am sure will never come to no good, for he is always
a miching and doing those kind of things (he was catch but yesterday
in a skittle grounds) he only makes his book all dog’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> ears. I beat
he, too, pretty smartish, as I ought, you will say, for to have did. I
was going to have sent him away last week but he somehow got over me
as he do always. I have had so much trouble with he, that between you
and I, if I was not paid for it, I wouldn’t have no more to do with
such a boy. There never wasn’t a monkey more mischievious than him;
and a donkey isn’t more stupider and not half so obstinate as that
youngster.”</p></div>

<p>The Syntax of the Interjection has been sufficiently stated under Rule V.
Interjections afford more matter for consideration in a Treatise on
Elocution than they do in a work on Grammar; but there is one observation
which we are desirous of making respecting them, and which will not, it is
hoped, be thought altogether foreign to our present subject. Almost every
interjection has a great variety of meanings, adapted to particular
occasions and circumstances, and indicated chiefly by the tone of the
voice. Of this proposition we shall now give a few illustrations, which we
would endeavour to render still clearer by the addition of musical notes,
but that these would hardly express, with adequate exactness, the
modulations of sound to which we allude; and besides, we hope to be
sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> understood without such help. This part of the Grammar
should be read aloud by the student; or, which is better still, the
interjection, where it is possible, should be repeated with the proper
intonation by a class; the sentence which gives occasion to it being read
by the preceptor. We will select the interjection Oh! as the source from
which our examples are to be drawn.</p>

<p>“I’ll give it you, you idle dog: I will!”</p>

<p>“Oh, pray, Sir! Oh, pray, Sir! Oh! Oh! Oh!”</p>

<p>“I shall ever have the highest esteem for you, Sir; but as to love, that
is out of the question.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Matilda!”</p>

<p>“I say, Jim, look at that chaffinch: there’s a shy!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Crikey!”</p>

<p>“Miss Tims, do you admire Lord Byron?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!”</p>

<p>“What do you think of Rubini’s singing?”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“So then, you see, we popped round the corner, and caught them just in the
nick of time.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Sir, your behaviour has done you great credit.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Oats are looking up.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>“Honourable Members might say what they pleased; but he was convinced, for
his part, that the New Poor Law had given great general satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!”</p>

<p>There being now no reason (or rule) to detain us in the Syntax, we shall
forthwith advance into Prosody, where we shall have something to say, not
only about rules, but also of measures.</p>

<h2>PART IV.<br />PROSODY.</h2>


<p>Prosody consists of two parts; wherefore, although it may be a topic, a
head, or subject for discussion, it can never be a point; for a <i>point</i> is
that which hath <i>no</i> parts. Besides, there are a great many <i>lines</i> to be
considered in the second part of Prosody, which treats of Versification.
The first division teaches the true Pronunciation of Words, including
Accent, Quantity, Emphasis, Pause, and Tone.</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield’s book about manners, which is intended to teach us the

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p class="title">OF PRONUNCIATION.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SECTION I.</p>
<p class="center">OF ACCENT.</p>

<p>Though <i>penetrated</i> ourselves by the desire of imparting instruction, we
are far from wishing to <i>bore</i> our readers; and therefore we shall
endeavour to repeat nothing here that we have said before.</p>

<p>Accent is the marking with a peculiar stress of the voice a particular
letter or syllable in a word, in such a manner as to render it more
distinct or audible than the rest. Thus, in the word <i>théatre</i>, the stress
of the voice should be on the letter <i>e</i> and first syllable <i>the</i>; and in
<i>cóntrary</i>, on the first syllable <i>con</i>. How shocking it is to hear people
say <i>con-tráry</i>, <i>the-átre</i>! The friends of education will be reminded
with regret, that an error in the pronunciation of the first of these
words is very early impressed on the human mind.</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>“Mary, Mary,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Quite contráry,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">How does your garden grow?”</span></p>

<p>How many evils, alas! arise from juvenile associations!</p>

<p>Words of two syllables never have more than one of them accented, except
for the sake of peculiar emphasis. Gentlemen, however, whose profession it
is to drive certain public vehicles called cabs, are much accustomed to
disregard this rule, and to say, “pó-líte” (or “púr-líte”), “gén-téel,”
“cón-cérn,” “pó-líce,” and so on: nay, they go so far as to convert a word
of one syllable into two, for the sake of indulging in this style of
pronunciation; and thus the word “queer” is pronounced by them as
“ké-véer.”</p>

<p>The word “á-mén,” when standing alone, should be pronounced with two
accents.</p>

<p>The accents in which it usually <i>is</i> pronounced are very inelegant.
Clerks, now-a-days, alas! are no scholars.</p>

<p>Dissyllables, formed by adding a termination, usually have the former
syllable accented: as, “Fóolish, blóckhead,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>The accent in dissyllables, formed by prefixing a syllable to the radical
word, is commonly on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> latter syllable: as, “I protést, I decláre, I
entréat, I adóre, I expíre.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img37.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center"><small>ALL FOR LOVE.</small></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Protestations, declarations, entreaties, and adorations, proclaim a swain
to be simply tender; but <i>expiration</i> (for love) proves him to be
decidedly soft.</p>

<p>A man who turns lover becomes a <i>protest</i>-ant; and his conduct at the same
time generally undergoes a <i>reformation</i>, especially if he has previously
been a rake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>The zeal, however, of a reformed rake, like that of Jack in Dean Swift’s
“Tale of a Tub,” is sometimes apt to outrun his discretion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img38.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the same word, being a dissyllable, is both a noun and a verb, the
verb has mostly the accent on the latter, and the noun on the former
syllable: as,</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>“Molly, let Hymen’s gentle hand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Cemént our hearts together,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With such a cément as shall stand</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In spite of wind and weather.</span><br />
<br />
“I do preságe&mdash;and oft a fact<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A présage doth foretoken&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Our mutual love shall ne’er contráct,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Our cóntract ne’er be broken.”</span></p>

<p>There are many exceptions to the rule just enunciated (so that, correctly
as well as familiarly speaking, it is perhaps <i>no</i> rule); for though verbs
seldom have an accent on the former, yet nouns frequently have it on the
latter syllable: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Mary Anne is my delíght<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Both by day and eke by night;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For by day her soft contról</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Soothes my heart and calms my soul;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And her image while I doze</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Comes to sweeten my repóse;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fortune favouring my desígn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Please the pigs she shall be mine!”</span></p>

<p>The former syllable of most dissyllables ending in <i>y</i>, <i>our</i>, <i>ow</i>, <i>le</i>,
<i>ish</i>, <i>ck</i>, <i>ter</i>, <i>aye</i>, <i>en</i>, <i>et</i>, is accented: as, “Gránny, nóodle,”
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Except allów, avów, endów, bestów, belów.</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">“Sir, I cannot allów</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You your flame to avów;</span><br />
Endów yourself first with the rhino:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My hand to bestów</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On a fellow belów</span><br />
Me!&mdash;I’d rather be&mdash;never mind&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>I</i> know.”</span></p>

<p>“Music,” in the language of the Gods, is sometimes pronounced “mú-síc!”</p>

<p>Nouns of two syllables ending in <i>er</i>, have the accent on the former
syllable: as, “Bútcher, báker.”</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, a singular thing, that persons who pursue the callings
denoted by the two words selected as examples, should always indicate
their presence at an area by crying out, in direct defiance of Prosody,
“But-chér, ba-kér;” the latter syllable being of the two the more strongly
accented.</p>

<p>Dissyllabic verbs ending in a consonant and e final, as “Disclose,”
“repine,” or having a diphthong in the last syllable, as, “Believe,”
“deceive,” or ending in two consonants, as “Intend,” are accented on the
latter syllable.</p>

<p class="poem">“Matilda’s eyes a light disclóse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Which with the star of Eve might vie;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh! that such lovely orbs as those</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Should sparkle at an apple-pie!</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span><br />
“Thy love I thought was wholly mine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Thy heart I fondly hoped to rule;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Its throne I cannot but repíne</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">At sharing with a goosb’ry fool!</span><br />
<br />
“Thou swear’st no flatterer can decéive<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Thy mind,&mdash;thy breast no coxcomb rifle;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thou art no trifler, I beliéve,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But why so plaguy fond of trifle?</span><br />
<br />
“Why, when we’re wed&mdash;I don’t inténd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To joke, Matilda, or be funny;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I really fear that you will spend</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The Honey Moon in eating honey!”</span></p>

<p>Most dissyllabic nouns, having a diphthong in the latter syllable, have
the accent also on that syllable: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“A Hamlet that draws<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Is sure of appláuse.”</span></p>

<p>A Hamlet that <i>draws</i>? There are not many who can give even an outline of
the character.</p>

<p>In a few words ending in <i>ain</i> the accent is placed on the former
syllable: as, “Víllain,” which is pronounced as the natives of Whitechapel
pronounce “willing.”</p>

<p>Those dissyllables, the vowels of which are separated in pronunciation,
always have the accent on the first syllable: as, lion, scion, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>When is a young and tender shoot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a fond swain? When ’tis a <i>scíon</i>.</span><br />
What’s the most gentlemanly brute<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like, of all flow’rs? A <i>dandy</i> líon.</span></p>

<p>Trisyllables, formed by adding a termination or prefixing a syllable,
retain the accent of the radical word: as, “Lóveliness, shéepishness,
Whíggery, knávery, assúrance.”</p>

<p>The first syllable of trisyllables ending in <i>ous</i>, <i>al</i>, <i>ion</i>, is
accented in the generality of cases: as in the words “sérious, cápital,”
&amp;c.</p>

<p class="poem">“Dr. Johnson declared, with a sérious face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That he reckoned a punster a villain:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">What would he have thought of the horrible case</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Of a man who makes jokes that are <i>killing</i>?</span><br />
<br />
“In his díction to speak ’tis not easy for one<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Who must furnish both reason and rhyme;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sir, the rogue who has utter’d a cápital pun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Has committed a cápital crime.”</span></p>

<p>Trisyllables ending in <i>ce</i>, <i>ent</i>, <i>ate</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>le</i>, and <i>ude</i>,
commonly accent the first syllable. Many of those, however, which are
derived from words having the accent on the last syllable, and of those of
which the middle syllable has a vowel between two consonants, are
excepted.</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>They who would elegantly speak<br />
Should not say “ímpudence,” but “cheek;”<br />
Should all things éatable call “prog;”<br />
Eyes “ogles,” cóuntenance “phisog.”<br />
A coach should nóminate a “drag,”<br />
And spécify as “moke,” a nag:<br />
For éxcellent, use “prime” or “bang up,”<br />
Or “out and out;” and “scrag,” for hang up.<br />
The théatre was wont to teach<br />
The public réctitude of speech,<br />
But we who live in modern age<br />
Consult the gallery, not the stage.</p>

<p>Trisyllables ending in <i>ator</i> have the accent placed on the middle
syllable; as, “Spectátor, narrátor,” &amp;c. except órator, sénator, and a few
other words.</p>

<p>Take care that you never pronounce the common name of the vegetable
sometimes called Irish wall-fruit, “purtátor.”</p>

<p>A diphthong in the middle syllable of a trisyllable is accented: as also,
in general, is a vowel before two consonants: as, “Doméstic,” “endéavour.”</p>

<p>An endeavour to appear domesticated, or in common phraseology, to “do” the
domestic, is sometimes made by young gentlemen, and generally with but an
ill grace. Avoid such attempts, reader, on all occasions: and in
particular never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> adventure either to nurse babies, or (when you shall
have “gone up to the ladies”) to pour water into the tea-pot from the
kettle. A legal or medical student sometimes thinks proper, from a desire
of appearing at once gallant and facetious, to usurp the office of pouring
out the tea itself, on which occasions he is very apt to betray his
uncivilised habits by an unconscious but very unequivocal manipulation
used in giving malt liquor what is technically termed a “head.”</p>

<p>Many polysyllables are regulated as to accent by the words from which they
are derived: as, “Inexpréssibles, Súbstituted, Unobjéctionably,
Désignated, Transatlántic, Délicacy, Decídedly, Unquéstionable.”</p>

<p>Words ending in <i>ator</i> are commonly accented on the last syllable but one,
let them be as long as they may: as, respirátor, regulátor, renovátor,
indicátor, and all the other <i>ators</i> that we see in the newspapers.</p>

<p>A cockney, quoting Dr. Johnson, said, “Sir, I love a good <i>ator</i>.”</p>

<p>Words that end in <i>le</i> usually have the accent on the first syllable: as,
“Ámicable, déspicable,” &amp;c.: although we <i>have</i> heard people say
“despícable.” “I never see such a despícable fellow, not in all my born
days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>Words of this class, however, the second syllable of which has a vowel
before two consonants, are often differently accented: as in “Respéctable,
contémptible.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img39.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center">“A respectable Man.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>Many words ending in <i>ion</i>,
<i>ous</i>, <i>ty</i>, <i>ia</i>, <i>io</i>, and <i>cal</i>, have their
accent on the last syllable but two: as, “Con-si-de-rá-ti-on,
pro-dí-gi-ous, im-pe-ne-tra-bíl-i-ty, en-cy-clo-pæ´-di-a, brag-ga-dó-ci-o,
an-ti-mo-nárch-i-cal,” all of which words we have divided into syllables,
by way of a hint that they are to be pronounced (comically speaking) after
the manner of Dominie Sampson.</p>

<p>Having, in compliance with grammatical usage, laid down certain rules with
regard to accent, we have to inform the reader that there are so many
exceptions to almost all of them, that perhaps there is scarcely one which
it is worth while to attend to. We hope we have in some measure amused
him; but as to instruction, we fear that, in this part of our subject, we
have given him very little of that. Those who would acquire a correct
accent had better attend particularly to the mode of speaking adopted in
good society; avoid debating clubs; and go to church. For farther
satisfaction and information we refer them, and we beg to say that we are
not joking&mdash;to <i>Walker</i>.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SECTION II.</p>
<p class="center">OF QUANTITY.</p>

<p>The quantity of a syllable means the time taken up in pronouncing it. As
there is in Arithmetic a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> long division and a short division, so in
Prosody is Quantity considered as long or short.</p>

<p>A syllable is said to be long, when the accent is on the vowel, causing it
to be slowly joined in pronunciation to the next letter: as, “Flēa,
smāll, crēature.”</p>

<p>A syllable is called short, when the accent lies on the consonant, so that
the vowel is quickly joined to the succeeding letter: as “Crăck,
lĭttle, dĕvil.”</p>

<p>The pronunciation of a long syllable commonly occupies double the time of
a short one: thus, “Pāte,” and “Brōke,” must be pronounced as slowly
again as “Păt,” and “Knŏck.”</p>

<p>We have remarked a curious tendency in the more youthful students of
Grammar to regard the quantity of words (in their lessons) more as being
“small” or “great” than as coming under the head of “long” or “short.”
Their predilection for small quantities of words is very striking and
peculiar; food for the mind they seem to look upon as physic; and all
physic, in their estimation, is most agreeably taken in infinitesimal
doses. The Homœopathic system of acquiring knowledge is more to their
taste than even the Hamiltonian.</p>

<p>It is quite impossible to give any rules as to quantity worth reading. The
Romans may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> submitted to them, but that is no reason why we should.
We will pronounce our words as we please: and if foreigners want to know
why, we will tell them that, when there is no Act of Parliament to the
contrary, an Englishman always does as he likes with his own.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img40.jpg" alt="" /></p>


<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">SECTION III.</p>
<p class="center">OF EMPHASIS.</p>

<p>Emphasis is the distinguishing of some word or words in a sentence, on
which we wish to lay particular stress, by a stronger and fuller sound,
and sometimes by a particular tone of the voice.</p>

<p>A few illustrations of the importance of emphasis will be, perhaps, both
agreeable and useful.</p>

<p>When a young lady says to a young gentleman, “You are a <i>nice</i> fellow; you
<i>are</i>!”&mdash;she means one thing.</p>

<p>When a young gentleman, addressing one of his own sex, remarks, “<i>You</i>’re
a nice fellow; <i>you</i> are;”&mdash;he means another thing.</p>

<p>“Your friend is a gentleman,” pronounced without any particular emphasis,
is the simple assertion of a fact.</p>

<p>“Your <i>friend</i> is a <i>gentleman</i>,” with the emphasis on the words “friend”
and “gentleman,” conveys an insinuation besides.</p>

<p>So simple a question as “Do you like pine-apple rum?” is susceptible of as
many meanings as there are words in it; according to the position of the
emphasis.</p>

<p>“<i>Do</i> you like pine-apple rum?” is as much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> to say, “Do you, though,
really like pine-apple rum?”</p>

<p>“Do <i>you</i> like pine-apple rum?” is tantamount to, “Can it be that a young
gentleman (or lady) like you, can like pine-apple rum?”</p>

<p>“Do you <i>like</i> pine-apple rum?” means, “Is it possible that instead of
disliking, you are fond of pine-apple rum?”</p>

<p>“Do you like <i>pine-apple</i> rum?” is an enquiry as to whether you like that
kind of rum in particular.</p>

<p>And lastly, “Do you like pine-apple <i>rum</i>?” is equivalent to asking if you
think that the flavour of the pine-apple improves that especial form of
alcohol.</p>

<p>A well-known instance of an emphasis improperly placed was furnished by a
certain Parson, who read a passage in the Old Testament in the following
unlucky manner: “And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass; and they
saddled <i>him</i>.”</p>

<p>Young ladies are usually very emphatic in ordinary discourse. “What a
little <i>dear</i>! <i>Oh!</i> how <i>sweetly</i> pretty! Well! I never <i>did</i>, I declare!
<i>So</i> nice, and <i>so</i> innocent, and <i>so</i> good-tempered, and <i>so</i>
affectionate, and <i>such</i> a colour! And <i>oh! such lovely eyes!</i> and such
hair! He <i>was</i> a little duck! he <i>was</i>, he <i>was</i>, he <i>was</i>. Tzig a tzig,
tzig, tzig, tzig, tzig!” &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img41.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This emphatic way of speaking is indicative of two very amiable feelings
implanted by nature in the female occiput, and called by the Phrenologists
Adhesiveness and Philoprogenitiveness. Those who attempt to imitate it
will be conscious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> while forcing out their words, of a peculiar mental
emotion, which we cannot explain otherwise than by saying, that it is
analogous to that which attends the act of pressing or squeezing; as when,
with the thumb of the right hand, we knead one lump of putty to another,
in the palm of the left. Perhaps we might also instance, sucking an
orange. In all these cases, the organ of Weight, according to Phrenology,
is also active; and this, perhaps, is one of the faculties which induce
young ladies to lay a stress upon their words. Nevertheless, we fear that
a damsel would hardly be pleased by being told that her <i>weight</i> was
considerable, though it would, at the same time, grievously offend her to
accuse her of <i>lightness</i>. Here we need scarcely observe, that we refer to
lightness, not of complexion, but of sentiment, which is always regarded
as a <i>dark</i> shade in the character. This defect, we think, we may safely
assert, will never be observed in emphatic fair ones.</p>

<p>But we have not yet quite exhausted the subject of emphasis, considered in
relation to young ladies. Their letters are as emphatic as their language
is, almost every third word being underlined. Such epistles, inasmuch as
they are addressed to the heart, ought not to be submitted to the ear;
nevertheless we must say that we have occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> been wicked and
waggish enough to read them aloud&mdash;to ourselves alone, of course. The
reader may, if he choose, follow our example. We subjoin a specimen of
female correspondence, endeared to us by many tender recollections, and
admirably adapted to our present purpose.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>My <i>dear Paul</i>,</p>

<p>When we left <i>Town</i> on <i>Wednesday last</i> the weather was so very
<i>rainy</i> that we were <i>obliged</i> to have the <i>coach windows</i> up. I was
<i>terribly</i> afraid that <i>Matilda</i> and I would have caught our <i>Death</i>
of <i>cold</i>; but thank <i>Goodness</i> no such <i>untoward</i> event took place.
It was <i>very uncomfortable</i>, and I <i>so</i> wished <i>you had been there</i>.
When we got <i>home</i> who <i>do you think</i> was there? Mr. <i>Sims</i>; and he
<i>said</i> he <i>thought</i> that I was <i>so</i> much <i>grown</i>. Only <i>think</i>. And so
then you know we took some <i>refreshment</i>, for <i>I assure</i> you, what
with the <i>journey</i> and <i>altogether</i> we were very <i>nearly famished</i>;
and we were <i>all invited</i> to go to the <i>Chubbs’</i> that <i>Evening</i> to a
small <i>Tea Party</i>, for which I <i>must own</i> I <i>thought Mr. Chubb</i> a
<i>nice man</i>. After tea we had a <i>carpet waltz</i>, and although I was
<i>very tired</i> I <i>enjoyed</i> it <i>much</i>. There were some <i>very pretty
girls</i> there, and <i>one</i> or <i>two agreeable young men</i>; but <i>oh!</i> &amp;c.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>The remainder of this letter being of a nature personally interesting to
ourselves only, and likely, in the opinion of some readers, to render its
insertion attributable to motives of vanity, we shall not be found fault
with for objecting to transcribe any more of it.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SECTION IV.</p>
<p class="center">OF PAUSES.</p>

<p>A Pause, otherwise called a rest, is an absolute cessation of the voice,
in speaking or reading, during a perceptible interval, longer or shorter,
of time.</p>

<p>Comic Pauses often occur in Oratory. “Unaccustomed as I am to public
speaking,” is usually followed by a pause of this sort. A young gentleman,
his health having been drunk at a party, afforded, in endeavouring to
return thanks, a signal illustration of the Pause Comic. “Gentlemen,” he
began, “the Ancient Romans,”&mdash;(A pause),&mdash;“I say, Gentlemen, the Ancient
Romans,”&mdash;(Hear!)&mdash;“The Ancient Romans, Gentlemen,”&mdash;(Bravo! hear!
hear!)&mdash;“Gentlemen&mdash;that is&mdash;the Ancient Romans”&mdash;“were very fine fellows,
Jack, I dare say,” added a friend, pulling the speaker down by the
coat-tail.</p>

<p>That notable Ancient Roman, Brutus, is represented by Shakspere as making
a glorious pause: as,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>“Who’s here so vile that would not love his country? If any, speak, for
him have I offended. I pause for a reply.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img42.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>Here, of course, Brutus pauses, folds his arms, and looks magnanimous. We
have heard, though, of an idle and impudent schoolboy, who, at a public
recitation, when he had uttered the words “I pause for a reply,” gravely
took out his penknife and began paring his nails.</p>

<p>This <i>was</i> minding his <i>paws</i> with a vengeance.</p>

<p>A very long pause, particularly accompanied by a very serious look on the
part of the speaker, as good as tells the audience that something of great
importance is coming. It is therefore necessary to have something of real
consequence to bring out. The following extract from a political harangue
will show how essential it is to attend to this point:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“And, Gentlemen, when I consider, I say, when I consider the condition
of the masses of this country, I do think, and it is my opinion, that
the Government has much to answer for. But not to dwell on that point,
what have been the deeds, what have been the proceedings, I may say,
of the Government itself? They have increased taxation, they have
swelled the National Debt, they have assailed the liberty of the
subject, they have trampled the poor man in the dust; he asked for
liberty, and they made him a slave; he demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> the Charter, and they
loaded him with fetters; he knelt for protection, and they gave him
the Poor Law; he cried for bread, and they gave him the bayonet. By
what name, by what term, by what expression, are we to designate such
tyranny? (A long pause) ... Gentlemen!&mdash;it is <i>unconstitutional</i>!!!”</p></div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SECTION V.</p>
<p class="center">OF TONES.</p>

<p>Tones consist of the modulations of the voice, or the notes or variations
of sound which we use in speaking: thus differing materially both from
emphasis and pauses.</p>

<p>An interesting diversity of <i>tones</i> is exhibited by the <i>popular voice</i> at
an election.</p>

<p>Also by dust-men, milk-women, and pot-boys; and by fruiterers,
hearth-stone-venders, ballad-singers, Last-Dying-Speech-hawkers, and old
clothesmen itinerant.</p>

<p>We cannot exactly write tones (though it is easy enough to write notes),
but we shall nevertheless endeavour to give some idea of their utility.</p>

<p>A lover and a police-magistrate (unless the two characters should chance
to be combined, which sometimes happens, that is, when the latter is a
lover of justice) would say, “Answer me,” in very different tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>Observe, that two doves billing resemble two magistrates bowing;&mdash;because
they are beak to beak.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img43.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A lover again would utter the words “For ever and ever,” in a very
different tone from that in which a Parish Clerk would repeat them.</p>

<p>A young lady, on her first introduction to you, says, “Sir,” in a tone
very unlike that in which she sometime afterwards delivers herself of the
same monosyllable when she is addressing you under the influence of
jealousy.</p>

<p>As to the word “Sir,” the number of constructions which, according to the
tone in which it is spoken, it may be made to bear, are incalculable. We
may adduce a few instances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>“Please, Sir, let me off my imposition.”</p>

<p>“No, Sir!”</p>

<p>“Waiter! you, Sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir! yes, Sir!”</p>

<p>“Sir, I am greatly obliged to you.”</p>

<p>“Sir, you are quite welcome.”</p>

<p>“Your servant, Sir” (by a man who brings you a challenge).</p>

<p>“’Servant, Sir” (by a tailor bowing you to the door).</p>

<p>“Sir, you are a gentleman!”</p>

<p>“Sir, you are a scoundrel!”</p>

<p>We need not go on with examples ad infinitum. If after what we have said
anybody does not understand the nature of Tone, all we shall say of him
is, that he is a <i>Tony</i> Lumpkin.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p class="title">OF VERSIFICATION.</p>


<p>Hurrah!</p>

<p>It is with peculiar pleasure that we approach this part of Prosody; and we
have therefore prefaced it with an exclamation indicative of delight. We
belong to a class of persons to whom a celebrated phrenological
manipulator ascribes “some poetical feeling, if studied or called forth;”
and, to borrow another expression from the same quarter, we sometimes
“versify a little;” that is to say, we <i>di</i>versify our literary
occupations by an occasional flirtation with the muses. Now it gives us
great concern to observe that popular literature is becoming very prosaic.
Poetry and Boxing have gone out of favour together, and most
probably,&mdash;though we have not quite time enough just at present to show
how,&mdash;from the same cause; namely, bad taste. We mention Boxing along with
Poetry, because it is remarkable that their decline should have been
contemporaneous; and because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> we are of those who believe that there
exists an essential similarity between all the branches of the Fine Arts;
and moreover, because&mdash;and we mention it as a fact no less singular in
itself than creditable to the paper in question&mdash;that a celebrated weekly
periodical bestows especial patronage on both. With regard to Boxing, we
are glad to see that a few patriotic individuals have of late been
endeavouring to revive the taste for it; and we have some hope that their
exertions, backed by certain cases of stabbing which every now and then
occur, will eventually prove successful. But no one can be found to labour
in an equal degree for the advancement of poetry. Our innate modesty is
prompting us to say, that we fear we can do but little in the cause; but
early impressions are known to be very strong and lasting: and we have a
notion that, in teaching youth to make verses, we shall in a great degree
contribute to the breeding up of a race of poets, and thereby secure, not
only laurels, at least, for them, but also gratitude, veneration, and all
that kind of thing, for ourselves.</p>

<p>We have a great respect for the memory of our old schoolmaster;
notwithstanding which, we think we can beat him (which, we shall be told
by the wags, would be tit for tat) at poet-making, though, indeed, he was
a magician in his way. “I’ll make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> thee a poet, my boy,” he used to say,
“or the rod shall.”</p>

<p>Let us try what <i>we</i> can do.</p>

<p>A verse consists of a certain number and variety of syllables, put
together and arranged according to certain laws.</p>

<p>Verses being also called dulcet strains, harmonious numbers, tuneful lays,
and so forth, it is clear that such combination and arrangement must be so
made as to please the ear.</p>

<p>Versification is the making of verses. This seems such a truism as to be
not worth stating; but it is necessary to define what Versification is,
because many people suppose it to be the same thing with poetry. We will
prove that it is not.</p>

<p class="poem">“Much business in the Funds has lately been<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Transacted various monied men between;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Though speculation early in the week</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Went slowly; nought was done whereof to speak.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The largest operations, it was found,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Were twenty-five and fifty thousand <i>pound</i>;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The former in reduced Annuities,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And in the Three per Cents. the last of these.”</span></p>

<p>We might proceed in the same strain, but we have already done eight verses
without a particle of poetry in them; and we do not wish to overwhelm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
people with proofs of what a great many will take upon trust.</p>

<p>Every fool knows what Rhyme is; so we need not say anything about that.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">OF POETICAL FEET.</p>

<p>Poetical feet! Why, Fanny Elsler’s feet and Taglioni’s feet are poetical
feet&mdash;are they not? or else what is meant by calling dancing the Poetry of
Motion? And cannot each of those <i>artistes</i> boast of a toe which is the
very essence of all poetry&mdash;a ΤΟ` ΚΑΛΟ`Ν?</p>

<p>No. You may make verses <i>on</i> Taglioni’s feet, (though if she be a poetess,
she can do that better than you, standing, too, on one leg, like the man
that Horace speaks of); but you cannot make them <i>of</i> her feet. Feet <i>of</i>
which verses are composed are made of syllables, not of bones, muscles,
and ligaments.</p>

<p>Feet and pauses are the constituent parts of a verse.</p>

<p>We have heard one boy ask another, who was singing, “How much is that a
yard?” still the yard is not a poetical measure.</p>

<p>The feet which are used in poetry consist either of two or of three
syllables. There are four kinds of feet of two, and an equal number of
three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> syllables. Four and four are eight: therefore Pegasus is an
octoped; and if our readers do not understand this logic, we are sorry for
it. But as touching the feet&mdash;we have</p>

<p>1. The Trochee, which has the first syllable accented, and the last
unaccented: as, “Yānkĕe dōodlĕ.”</p>

<p>2. The Iambus, which has the first syllable unaccented, and the last
accented: as, “Thĕ māid hĕrsēlf wĭth roūge, ălās!
bĕdaūbs.”</p>

<p>3. The Spondee, which has both the words or syllables accented: as,
“Āll hāil, grēat kīng, Tōm Thūmb, āll haīl!”</p>

<p>4. The Pyrrhic, which has both the words or syllables unaccented: as,
“Ŏn thĕ tree-top.”</p>

<p>5. The Dactyl, which has the first syllable accented and the two latter
unaccented: as, “Jōnăthăn, Jēffĕrsŏn.”</p>

<p>6. The Amphibrach has the first and last syllables unaccented and the
middle one accented: as, “Oĕ’rwħelmĭng, trănspōrtĕd,
ĕcstātĭc, dĕlīghtfŭl, ăccēptĕd,
ăddrēssĕs.”</p>

<p>7. The Anapæst (or as we used to say, <i>Nasty-beast</i>) has the two first
syllables unaccented and the last accented: as, “Ŏvĕrgrōwn
grĕnădiēr.”</p>

<p>8. The Tribrach has all its syllables unaccented: as, “Matrĭmŏny̆,
exquĭsĭtenĕss.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>These feet are divided into <i>principal</i> feet, out of which pieces of
poetry may be wholly or chiefly formed; and <i>secondary</i> feet, the use of
which is to diversify the number and improve the verse.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to explain the nature of the principal feet.</p>

<p>Iambic verses are of several kinds, each kind consisting of a certain
number of feet or syllables.</p>

<p>1. The shortest form of the English Iambic consists of an Iambus, with an
additional short syllable, thus coinciding with the Amphibrach: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Whăt, Sūsăn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">My beauty!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Refuse one</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">So true t’ ye?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This ditty</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Of sadness</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Begs pity</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For madness.”</span></p>

<p>2. The second form of the English Iambic consists of <i>two</i> Iambuses, and
sometimes takes an additional short syllable: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“My̆ eȳe, whăt fūn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With dog and gun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And song and shout,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To roam about!</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And shoot our snipes!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And smoke our pipes!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or eat at ease,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Beneath the trees,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Our bread and cheese!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To rouse the hare</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">From gloomy lair;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To scale the mountain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And ford the fountain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">While rustics wonder</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To hear our thunder.”</span></p>

<p>Everybody has heard of the “Cockney School,” of course.</p>

<p>3. The third form consists of <i>three</i> Iambuses: as in the following
<i>morceau</i>, the author of which is, we regret to say, unknown to us; though
we <i>did</i> once hear somebody say that it was a Mr. Anon.</p>

<p class="poem">“Jăck Sprāt ĕat āll thĕ fāt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">His wife eat all the lean,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And so between them both,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They lick’d the platter clean.”</span></p>

<p>In this verse an additional short syllable is also admitted: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Ălēxĭs, yoūthfŭl ploūgh-bŏy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A shepherdess adored,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who loved fat Hodge, the cow-boy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">So t’other chap was floored.”</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>4. The fourth form is made up of four Iambuses: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Ădieū my̆ bōots, cŏmpāniŏns ōld,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">New footed twice, and four times soled;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My footsteps ye have guarded long,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Life’s brambles, thorns, and flints among;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And now you’re past the cobbler’s art,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And Fate declares that we must part.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ah me! what cordial can restore</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The gaping patch repatch’d before?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">What healing art renew the weal</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of subject so infirm of heel?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">What potion, pill, or draught control</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So deep an ulcer of the <i>sole</i>?”</span></p>

<p>5. The fifth species of English Iambic consists of <i>five</i> Iambuses: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Cŏme, Trāgĭc Mūse, ĭn tāttĕr’d vēst ărrāy’d,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And while through blood, and mud, and crimes I wade,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Support my steps, and this, my strain, inspire</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With Horror’s blackest thoughts and bluest fire!”</span></p>

<p>The Epic of which the above example is the opening, will perhaps appear
hereafter. This kind of Iambic constitutes what is called the Heroic
measure:&mdash;of which we shall have more to say by and by; but shall only
remark at present that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> it, in common with most of the ordinary English
measures, is susceptible of many varieties, by the admission of other
feet, as Trochees, Dactyls, Anapæsts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>6. Our Iambic in its sixth form, is commonly called the Alexandrine
measure. It consists of six Iambuses: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Hĭs wōrshĭp gāve thĕ wōrd, ănd Snōoks wăs bōrne ăwāy.”</p>

<p>The Alexandrine is sometimes introduced into heroic rhyme, and when used,
as the late Mr. John Reeve was wont to say, “with a little moderation,”
occasions an agreeable variety. Thus, the example quoted is preceded by
the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">“What! found at midnight with a darkey, lit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A bull-dog, jemmy, screw, and centre-bit</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And tongueless of his aim? It cannot be</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But he was bent, at least, on felony;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He stands remanded. ‘Ho! Policeman A!’</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">His Worship gave the word, and Snooks was borne away.”</span></p>

<p>7. The seventh and last form of our Iambic measure is made up of <i>seven</i>
Iambuses. This species of verse has been immortalised by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> adoption of
those eminent hands, Messrs. Sternhold and Hopkins. It runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">“Goŏd pēoplĕ āll, Ĭ prāy drăw nēar, fŏr yōu Ĭ neēds mŭst tēll,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That William Brown is dead and gone; the man you knew full well.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A broad brimm’d hat, black breeches, and an old Welch wig he wore:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And now and then a long brown coat all button’d up before.”</span></p>

<p>The present measure is as admirably adapted for the Platform as for the
Conventicle.</p>

<p class="poem">“My name it is Bill Scroggins, and my fate it is to die,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For I was at the Sessions tried and cast for felony.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My friends, to these my dying words I pray attention lend,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The public-house has brought me unto this untimely end.”</span></p>

<p>Verses of this kind are now usually broken into two lines, with four feet
in the first line, and three in the second: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Ĭ wīsh Ĭ wēre ă līttlĕ p̄ig<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To wallow in the mire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To eat, and drink, and sleep at ease</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Is all that I desire.”</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>Trochaic verse is of several kinds.</p>

<p>1. The shortest Trochaic verse in the English language consists of one
Trochee and a long syllable: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Bīlly̆ Blāck<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Got the sack.”</span></p>

<p>Lindley Murray asserts that this measure is defective in dignity, and can
seldom be used on serious occasions. Yet it is Pope who thus sings:</p>

<p class="poem">“Dreadful screams,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Dismal gleams.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fires that glow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shrieks of woe,” &amp;c.</span></p>

<p>And for our own poor part, let us see what we can make out of a storm.</p>

<p class="poem">“See the clouds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Like to shrouds</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">All so dun,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shepherds beat</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Swift retreat:</span><br />
<br />
“Lo you there!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">High in air</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Whirlwinds snatch</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Tiles and thatch!</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thund’ring fell!</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thunder rolls&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Save our souls!&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Welkin glares&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Lightning flares,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">While it splits</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oak to bits&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hail comes down&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh, my crown!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Patter crack!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Clatter whack!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">How it pours!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ocean roars,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Gracious Powers</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Safety’s ours!”</span></p>

<p>2. The second English form of the Trochaic consists of two feet: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Vērmĭcēllĭ,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Cūrrănt jēlly̆.”</span></p>

<p>It sometimes contains two feet, or trochees, with an additional long
syllable: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Yoūth ĭnclīned tŏ wēd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Go and shave thy head.”</span></p>

<p>3. The third species consists of three trochees: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Sīng ă son̄g ŏf sīxpĕnce.”</p>

<p>or of three trochees, with an additional long syllable: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Thrīce my̆ cōat, hăve ō’er thĕe rōll’d,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Summer hot and winter cold,</span><br />

“Now like works the most sublime,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Save where white a crack shines through;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">While thy parting seams declare</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thou’rt unfit for farther wear&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then, farewell! “What! Moses! ho!”</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">“Clo’, Sir? clo’, Sir? clo’, Sir? clo’?”</span></p>

<p>4. The fourth Trochaic species consists of four trochees: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Ūgh! yŏu līttlĕ lūmp ŏf blūbbĕr,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sleep, oh! sleep in quiet, do!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Cease awhile your bib to slobber&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Cease your bottle mouth to screw.</span><br />
<br />
“How I wish your eyelids never<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Would unclose again at all;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For I know as soon as ever</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">You’re awake, you’re sure to squall.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span><br />
“Dad and Mammy’s darling honey,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Tomb-stone cherub, stuff’d with slops,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Let each noodle, dolt, and spooney</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Smack, who will, your pudding chops.</span><br />
<br />
“As for me, as soon I’d smother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As I’d drown a sucking cat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You, you cub, or any other</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Nasty little squalling brat.”</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img44.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="center">“Would you, you disagreeable old Bachelor?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This form may take an additional long syllable, but this measure is very
uncommon. Example:</p>

<p class="poem">“Chrōnŏnhōtŏnthōlŏgōs thĕ Grēat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Godlike in a barrow kept his state.”</span></p>

<p>5. The fifth Trochaic species is likewise uncommon; and, as a Bowbellian
would say, “uncommon” ugly. It contains <i>five</i> trochees: as,</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>“Hēre lĭes Māry̆, wīfe ŏf Thōmăs Cārtĕr,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who to typhus fever proved a martyr.”</span></p>

<p>These are a specimen of the “uncouth rhymes” so touchingly alluded to by
Gray.</p>

<p>6. The sixth form of the English Trochaic is a line of six trochees: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Mōst bĕwītchĭng dāmsĕl, c̄harmĭng Ārăbēllă,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Prithee, cast an eye of pity on a fellow.”</span></p>

<p>The Dactylic measure is extremely uncommon. The following may be
considered an example of one species of it:</p>

<p class="poem">“Cēliă thĕ crūĕl, rĕsōlv’d nŏt tŏ mārry̆ sŏon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Boasts of a heart like a fortified garrison,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bulwarks and battlements keeping the <i>beaux</i> all off,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shot from within knocking lovers like foes all off.”</span></p>

<p>Anapæstic verses are of various kinds.</p>

<p>1. The shortest anapæstic verse is a single anapæst: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Ĭn thĕ glāss<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There’s an ass.”</span></p>

<p>This measure, after all, is ambiguous; for if the stress of the voice be
laid on the first and third syllables, it becomes trochaic. Perhaps,
therefore, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> is best to consider the first form of our Anapæstic verse,
as made up of two anapæsts: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Sĕt ă schōolbŏy ăt wōrk<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With a knife and a fork.”</span></p>

<p>And here, if you like, you may have another short syllable: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Ănd hŏw sōon thĕ yoŭng glūttŏn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Will astonish your mutton!”</span></p>

<p>2. The second species consists of three anapæsts: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Ămărȳllĭs wăs slēndĕr ănd tāll,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Colin Clodpole was dumpy and fat;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And tho’ <i>she</i> did’n’t like him at all,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Yet he doted on <i>her</i> for all that.”</span></p>

<p>This metre is sometimes donominated sing-song.</p>

<p>3. The third kind of <i>English</i> Anapæstics may be very well exemplified by
an <i>Irish</i> song:</p>

<p class="poem">“Hăve yŏu ē’er hăd thĕ lūck tŏ sĕe Dōnny̆brŏok Fāir?”</p>

<p>It consists, as will have been observed, of four anapæsts. Sometimes it
admits of a short syllable at the end of the verse: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Ĭn thĕ dēad ŏf thĕ nīght, whĕn wĭth dīre cătĕrwāulĭng<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Of grimalkins in chorus the house-tops resound;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">All insensibly drunk, and unconsciously sprawling</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In the kennel, how pleasant it is to be found!”</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>The various specimens of versification of which examples have been given,
may be improved and varied by the admission of secondary feet into their
composition; but as we are not writing an Art of Poetry, we cannot afford
to show how: particularly as the only way, after all, of acquiring a real
knowledge of the structure of English verse, is by extensive reading.
Besides, there yet remain a few Directions for Poetical Beginners, which
we feel ourselves called upon to give, and for which, if we do not take
care, we shall not have room.</p>

<p>The commencement of a poet’s career is usually the writing of <i>nonsense</i>
verses. The nonsense of these compositions is very often unintentional;
but sometimes words are put together avowedly without regard to sense, and
with no other view than that of acquiring a familiarity with metrical
arrangement: as,</p>

<p class="poem">“Approach, disdain, involuntary, tell.”</p>

<p>But this is dry work. It may be necessary to compose in this way just at
first, but in our opinion, there is a good and a bad taste to be displayed
even in writing nonsense verses; that is, verses which really deserve that
name. We recommend the young poet to make it his aim to render his
nonsense as <span class="smcaplc">PERFECT</span> as possible. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> will find many bright examples to
follow in the world of literature: but perhaps, for the present, he will
put up with our own.</p>

<p class="poem">“Conclusive tenderness; fraternal grog,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Tidy conjunction; adamantine bog,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Impetuous, arrant toadstool; Thundering quince,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Repentant dog-star, inessential Prince</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Expound. Pre-Adamite eventful gun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Crush retribution, currant-jelly, pun.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh! eligible Darkness, fender, sting</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Heav’n-born Insanity, courageous thing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Intending, bending, scouring, piercing all,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Death like pomatum, tea, and crabs must fall.”</span></p>

<p>A very good method of making nonsense verses, consists in taking bits,
selected here and there at random, out of some particular poet, or phrases
in his style, and then putting them together with a few additions of your
own <i>secundùm artem</i>. Sometimes, however, it answers very well to copy a
page or so of an author word for word. Nonsense verses composed in this
manner, form not only a beneficial exercise, but are also very useful for
insertion in young ladies’ albums; as they can be made without much
trouble, and when made, are not only thought just as well of as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> most
sensible productions would be, but very often cried over into the bargain,
as affecting and pathetic.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or, rather, like the shining balls that come</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Out of a Roman candle.”</span></p>

<p>However, we are not quite sure that, with the exception of the two last
lines, we have not quoted the rest of the foregoing example from memory.</p>

<p>It were manifestly culpable to make no mention, in a work of this sort, of
certain measures which are especially and essentially of a comic nature.
Some of these have been already adverted to, but two principal varieties
yet remain to be considered.</p>

<p>1. Measures taken from the Latin, in which the structure of the ancient
verse, as far as the number and arrangement of the feet are concerned, is
preserved, but the quantity of which is regulated in accordance with the
spirit of our own language. The character of such verses will be best
displayed by employing them on sentimental or serious subjects. Take, for
example, Long and Short, or Hexameter and Pentameter verses.</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>“Jūlĭă, gīrl ŏf my̆ heārt, ĭs thăn jēssămĭne swēetĕr, ŏr frēsh mēads<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Hāy-cŏvĕr’d; whāt rōse tīnts thōse ŏn hĕr chēeks, thăt flŏurīsh,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Approach? those bright eyes, what stars, what glittering dew-drops?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And oh! what Parian marble, or snow, that bosom?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If she my love return, what bliss will be greater than mine; but</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">What more deep sadness if she reprove my passion?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Either a bridegroom proud yon ivy-clad church shall receive me</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Soon; or the cold church-yard me with its turf shall cover.”</span></p>

<p>Or the Sapphic metre, of which the late Mr. Canning’s “Knife-Grinder” is
so brilliant an example. Sappho, fair reader, was a poetess, who made
love-verses which could be actually scanned. History relates that, for the
sake of some unprincipled or unfeeling fellow, she committed <i>felo de se</i>.</p>

<p class="poem">“‘Ī căn ēndūre thīs crŭĕl pāin nŏ lōngēr;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fare ye well, blue skies, rivers, fields, and song-birds!’</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thus the youth spoke: and adding, ‘Oh, Jemima!’</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Plunged in the billow!”</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img45.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Measures reducible to no rule, or Doggrel. Sternhold and Hopkins, of
whom such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> honourable mention has been made above, were illustrious as
Doggrel writers. They have been somewhat eclipsed, however, by their
modern successors, Nicholas Brady and Nahum Tate, who may, perhaps, be
safely pronounced the chief of <i>uninspired</i> bards.</p>

<p>Original composers in this description of verse are often not much more
particular about Syntax,&mdash;and we might add Orthography,&mdash;than they are
about Prosody. The following extract from an unpublished satire on the
singing of a country catch-club, is a tolerably fair specimen of English
Doggrel:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">“A gentleman, who was passing by,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Was very much amazed at what they were going to try,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Said, ‘Hear their voices, how they sing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">How badly they all chime in!’</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">After such singing, what do you think of us,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To send forth sounds of mirthfulness?”</span></p>

<p>Doggrel is commonly used by anonymous poets for the purpose of embodying
the moral reflections which a homicide or an execution excites in the
sensitive mind. It is likewise the metre in which the imaginative
sempstress pours forth the feelings of her bosom. May we hope that our
remarks on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> Prosody will in some little degree tend to facilitate, perhaps
to improve, the future treatment of those two deeply interesting
subjects&mdash;Love and Murder?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p class="title">PUNCTUATION.</p>


<p>“Mind your stops.” This is one of the earliest maxims inculcated by the
instructors of youth. Hence it is clear that the subject of Punctuation is
an important one; but inasmuch as the reader, who has arrived at the
present page, has either not understood a word that he has been reading,
or else knows as much about the matter as we can tell him, we fear that a
long dissertation concerning periods, commas, and so on, would only serve
to embarrass his progress in learning with useless <span class="smcaplc">STOPS</span>. We shall,
therefore, confine ourselves to that notice of Punctuation, and that only,
which the peculiar nature of our work may require.</p>

<p>First, it may be remarked, that the notes <i>of admiration</i> which we so
often hear in theatres, may be called <i>notes of hand</i>. Secondly, that
<i>notes of interrogation</i> are not at all like <i>bank notes</i>; although they
are largely uttered in <i>Banco Reginæ</i>. Let us now proceed with our
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>It is both absurd and inconvenient to stand upon <i>points</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img47.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of how much consequence, however, Punctuation is, the student may form
some idea, by considering the different effects which a piece of poetry,
for instance, which he has been accustomed to regard as sublime or
beautiful, will have, when liberties are taken with it in that respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>Imagine an actor commencing Hamlet’s famous soliloquy, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">“To be; or not to be that is. The question,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Or saying, in the person of Duncan, in Macbeth:</p>

<p class="poem">“This castle hath a pleasant seat, the air.”</p>

<p>Or as the usurper himself, exclaiming,</p>

<p class="poem">“The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where got’st thou that goose? Look!”</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/img48.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>Crying, as Romeo,</p>

<p class="poem">“It is my lady O! It is my love!”</p>

<p>Or in the character of Norval, in the tragedy of Douglas, giving this
account of himself and his origin:</p>

<p class="poem">“My name is Norval. On the Grampian hills<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My father feeds.”</span></p>

<p>In short, Punctuation is the soul of Grammar, as Punctuality is that of
business.</p>

<p>Perhaps somebody or other may take advantage of what we have said, to
prove both Punctuation and Punctuality <i>immaterial</i>. No matter.</p>

<p>How very punctual the present Ministers are! how well they <i>keep their
appointments</i>!</p>

<p>We have now said as much as we think it necessary to say on the head of
English Grammar. We shall conclude our labours with an “Address to Young
Students;” and as to the question, what that has to do with our subject,
we shall leave it to be settled by Lindley Murray, whose example, in this
respect, we follow. All we shall observe is, that in our opinion, advice
concerning manners stands in the same relation to a Comic English Grammar,
as instruction in morals does to a Serious one. For the remarks which it
will now be our business to make, we bespeak the indulgence of our elder
readers, and the attention of such as are of tender age.</p>

<h2>ADDRESS TO YOUNG STUDENTS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Young Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>Having attentively perused the foregoing pages, you will be desirous, it
is to be presumed, of carrying still further those comical pursuits in
which, with both pleasure and profit to yourselves, you have been lately
engaged. Should such be your laudable intention, you will learn, with
feelings of lively satisfaction, that it is one, in the accomplishment of
which, thanks to Modern Taste, you will find encouragement at every step.
The literature of the day is professedly comic, and of the few works which
are not made ludicrous by the design of their authors, the majority are
rendered so in spite of it. In the course of your reading, however, you
will be frequently brought into contact with hackney-coachmen, cabmen,
lackeys, turnkeys, thieves, lawyers’ clerks, medical students, and other
people of that description, who are all very amusing when properly viewed,
as the monkeys and such like animals at the Zoological Gardens are, when
you look at them through the bars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> of their cage. But too great
familiarity with persons of this class is sure to breed contempt, not for
them and their manners, but for the usages and modes of expression adopted
in parlours and drawing-rooms, that is to say, in good society. Nay, it is
very likely to cause those who indulge in it to learn various tricks and
eccentricities, both of behaviour and speech, for “It is certain, that
either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught, as men take diseases,
one of another.” Shakspere.</p>

<p>Beset thus, as you will necessarily be, by perils and dangers in your
wanderings amid the fields of Comicality, you will derive great advantage
from knowing before-hand what you are likely to meet with, and what it
will be incumbent on you to avoid. It is to furnish you with this
information that the following hints and instructions are intended.</p>

<p>Be careful, when you hear yourself called by name, to reply “Here I am,”
and not “Here you are,” an error into which you are very likely to be led
by the perusal of existing authors.</p>

<p>When you partake, if it be your habit to do so, of the beverage called
porter, drink it as you would water, or any other liquid. Do not wink your
eye, or nod sideways to your companion; such actions, especially when
preceded by blowing away the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> foam which collects on the top of the
vessel, being exceedingly inelegant: and in order that you may not be
incommoded by this foam or froth, always pour the fluid gently into a
tumbler, instead of drinking it out of the metallic tankard in which it is
usually brought to you.</p>

<p>In asking for malt liquor generally, never request the waiter to “draw it
mild;” and do not, on any occasion, be guilty of using the same phrase in
a metaphorical sense, that is to say, as a substitute, for “Do it
quietly.” “Be gentle,” and the like.</p>

<p>Never exhort young ladies, during a quadrille, to “fake away,” or to
“flare up,” for they, being unacquainted with the meaning of such terms,
will naturally conclude that it is an improper one.</p>

<p>Call all articles of dress by their proper names. What delight can be
found by a thinking mind in designating a hat as a tile, trousers,
kickseys, a neckerchief, a fogle, or a choker; or a great coat, an upper
Benjamin? And never speak of clothes, collectively, as togs or toggery.</p>

<p>Avoid inquiries after the health of another person’s mother, using that
word synonymously with Mamma, to denote a female parent. Though you may be
really innocent of any intention to be rude, your motives may very
possibly be misconstrued.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> Remember, also, on no account to put questions,
either to friends or strangers, respecting the quantity of soap in their
possession.</p>

<p>Should it be necessary for you to speak of some one smoking tobacco, do
not call that substance a weed, or the act of using it “blowing a cloud.”</p>

<p>When an acquaintance pays you a visit, take care, in rising to receive
him, not to appear to be washing your hands, and, should you be engaged in
writing at the time, place your pen on the table, or in the inkstand, and
not behind your ear.</p>

<p>Observe, when your tailor comes to measure you, the way in which he wears
his hair, and should your own style in this particular unfortunately
resemble his, be sure to alter it immediately.</p>

<p>Never dance <i>à la cuisinière</i>, that is to say, do not cut capers.</p>

<p>Eschew large shirt pins.</p>

<p>Be not guilty of patent leather boots.</p>

<p>Never say “Ma’am” or “Miss,” in addressing a young lady. If you cannot
contrive to speak to her without doing so, say nothing.</p>

<p>In conversation, especially in female society, beware of indulging in
jocose expressions, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> witticisms, on the subject of executions. If it be
necessary to remark that such and such a person expiated his crimes on the
scaffold, content yourself with simply mentioning the circumstance, and do
not make any attempt to illustrate your meaning by dropping your head on
your right shoulder, and jerking up your neckcloth under your left ear.</p>

<p>Never, under any circumstances, let the abbreviation “gent.” for
gentleman, escape the enclosure of your teeth. Above all things, for the
sake of whatever you hold most dear, never say “me and another gent.”</p>

<p>It may happen, that a youthful acquaintance may so far forget himself as
to talk of giving another “monkey’s allowance, more kicks than
half-pence.” You, of course, will never dream of giving utterance to such
language, nor will any inducement, it is to be hoped, ever prevail upon
you to say, as an unthinking young friend once did, hearing the above
threat made, “that you prefer <i>kicks</i> (meaning thereby sixpences) to
half-pence.” In general avoid all low wit.</p>

<p>When you receive a coin of any kind, deposit it at once in your pocket,
without the needless preliminary of furling it in the air.</p>

<p>Never ask a gentleman how much he has a-year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>In speaking of a person of your own age, or of an elderly gentleman, do
not say, Old So-and-So, but So-and-so, or <i>Mr.</i> So-and-so, as the case may
be: and have no nicknames for each other. We were much horrified not long
since, by hearing a great coarse fellow, in a leathern hat and fustian
jacket, exclaim, turning round to his companion, “Now, then, come along,
old Blokey!”</p>

<p>When you have got a cold in the head and weak eyes, do not go and call on
young ladies.</p>

<p>Do not eat gravy with a knife, for fear those about you should suppose you
to be going to commit suicide.</p>

<p>In offering to help a person at dinner, do not say, “Allow me to <i>assist</i>
you.” When you ask people what wine they will take, never say, “What’ll
you have?” or, “What’ll you <i>do it in</i>?”</p>

<p>If you are talking to a clergyman about another member of the clerical
profession, adopt some other method of describing his avocation than that
of saying, “I believe he is in your line.”</p>

<p>Do not recommend an omelet to a lady, as a good <i>article</i>.</p>

<p>Be cautious not to use the initial letter of a person’s surname, in
mentioning or in addressing him. For instance, never think of saying,
“Mrs. Hobbs, pray, how is Mr. H.?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>We here approach the conclusion of our labours. Young gentlemen, once more
it is earnestly requested that you will give your careful attention to the
rules and admonitions which have been above laid down for your guidance.
We might have given a great many more; but we hope that the spirit of our
instructions will enable the diligent youth to supply, by observation and
reflection, that which, for obvious reasons, we have necessarily left
unsaid. And now we bid you farewell. That you may never have the
misfortune of entering, with splashed boots, a drawing-room full of
ladies; that you may never, having been engaged in a brawl on the previous
evening, meet, with a black eye, the object of your affections the next
morning; that you may never, in a moment of agitation, omit the aspirate,
or use it when you ought not; that your laundress may always do justice to
your linen; and your tailor make your clothes well, and send them home in
due time; that your braces may never give way during a waltz; that you may
never, sitting in a strong light at a large dinner-party, suddenly
remember that you have not shaved for two days; that your hands and face
may ever be free from tan, chaps, freckles, pimples, brandy-blossoms, and
all other disfigurements; that you may never be either inelegantly fat, or
ridiculously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> lean; and finally, that you may always have plenty to eat,
plenty to drink, and plenty to laugh at, we earnestly and sincerely wish.
And should your lot in life be other than fortunate, we can only say, that
we advise you to bear it with patience; to cultivate Comic Philosophy; and
to look upon your troubles as a joke.</p>

<p><a name="f1" id="f1" href="#f1.1">[1]</a> It may be said that Punch is a foreign importation. True; and the same
assertion may be made respecting the drink of that name, the ingredients
of which are all exotic, except the water: nevertheless the peculiar
fondness of our countrymen for it will hardly on that account be
questioned. But the real fact is, that there is nothing outlandish about
Punch except the name, and even that has been Anglicised. We are
proverbial for improving on the inventions of other nations, but we have
done more than improve upon Punch; we have entirely remodelled his
character; and he is now no more an Italian than the descendant of one who
came in with the Conqueror is a Norman. The correctness of this position
will be found to be singularly borne out on a perusal of that celebrated
work, “Punch and Judy;” in which (no doubt from unavoidable circumstances)
the dialogues were actually taken down from the mouth of an Italian, one
Piccini, an itinerant exhibitor of the drama. The book is, or ought to be,
in everybody’s hands. Still, let any one refer to that particular part of
it, and, provided that his taste is a correct one, he will not fail to be
struck with the deteriorating effect which Signor Piccini’s broken English
and Italian loquacity have produced on the spirit of the original. Nothing
is more characteristic of the real Mr. Punch than the laconic manner in
which he expresses himself, and nothing at the same time is more English.
As to the embellishments of his discourse, introduced by Piccini, they are
about as appropriate and admirable as Colley Cibber’s improvements on
Richard the Third.</p>
